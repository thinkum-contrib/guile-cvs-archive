  This is a locally modified version of libltdl.

  guile-ltdl.h describes the interface that guile actually uses.

  guile-ltdl.c is the main source file which directly #includes
  raw-ltdl.h and raw-ltdl.c

  We use this unusual inclusion trick, along with a few modifications
  to the raw-* files and some #defines in guile-ltdl.c to allow us to
  use the upstream source with as few unnecessary changes as possible,
  while still making all of the upstream symbols non-extern.  This
  means that libguile-ltdl *only* exports the few symbols that guile
  actually needs right now.

  In general libguile-ltdl exports the needed libltdl functions and
  data structures with scm_ prepended to them, so we have
  scm_lt_dlinit, etc.

  The upstream/* subdirectory contains the clean upstream source and
  an automatically generated diff against our raw-* version.  Note
  that during the diff process we automatically remove a set of
  changes we've made to the upstream source (mostly related to making
  all of the upstream exports static) that are uninteresting outside
  of guile.

  We hope that taking these steps will make it easier to fold this our
  changes back into the main version of libltdl.

This is GNU libltdl, a system independent dlopen wrapper for GNU libtool.

It supports the following dlopen interfaces:
* dlopen (Solaris, Linux and various BSD flavors)
* shl_load (HP-UX)
* LoadLibrary (Win16 and Win32)
* load_add_on (BeOS)
* GNU DLD (emulates dynamic linking for static libraries)
* libtool's dlpreopen
