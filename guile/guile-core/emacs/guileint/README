This directory holds the Emacs side of an experimental Guile/Emacs
interface.  The Guile side of the interface is in ice-9/emacs.scm.

This interface has previously been developed by Mikael Djurfeldt - see
README.mdj for his notes - and is now being worked on (slowly!) by
Neil Jerram <neil@ossau.uklinux.net>.  Drop me a line if you're
interested in helping out.

There is no installation or distribution support here yet because this
code isn't yet intended to be installed or distributed.
