[ This is a locally hacked version of libltdl.  All exported symbols
  have the prefix scm_lt instead of lt.  We hope to fold this back
  into the main version of libltdl some time.

This is GNU libltdl, a system independent dlopen wrapper for GNU libtool.

It supports the following dlopen interfaces:
* dlopen (Solaris, Linux and various BSD flavors)
* shl_load (HP-UX)
* LoadLibrary (Win16 and Win32)
* load_add_on (BeOS)
* GNU DLD (emulates dynamic linking for static libraries)
* libtool's dlpreopen
