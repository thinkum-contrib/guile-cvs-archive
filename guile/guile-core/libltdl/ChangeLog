	* ltdl.c: Renamed all exported functions and variables to have a
	"scm_lt_" prefix.
	(try_dlopen): Set newhandle to null when try_all_dlopen failed.
	(scm_lt_dlopenext): Reverse test of "file_not_found()".
	Previously, we would stop searching when the file wasn't found
	yet, while we should continue in that case.
