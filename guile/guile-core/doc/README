This directory contains documentation on the Guile core.

The file `data-rep.texi' is an essay on how to write C code that uses
Guile values.  If you're interested in writing a application which is
extensible via Guile, this is a good place to start.  Make builds the
`info' manual by default, designed to be read on-line; if you want to
print it out, go to the `doc' subdirectory of the tree you're building
in, and run `make data-rep.ps'.

The file `oldfmt.c' contains a function which can be used by
application writers to support both old-style and new-style error
format strings.

A full manual has been written but not yet integrated into this
distribution.  For now, you can see snapshots of it (work in progress)
on-line at:

  http://www.glug.org/docbits/guile-doc-out/

  NOTE: Some of the features described in the on-line manual
        do not apply to Guile 1.4.x series.
