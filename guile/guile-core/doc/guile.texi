@c AUTHORS

@c The Guile reference and tutorial manuals were written and edited
@c largely by Mark Galassi and Jim Blandy.  In particular, Jim wrote the
@c original tutorial on Guile's data representation and the C API for
@c accessing Guile objects.

@c Significant portions were contributed by Gary Houston (contributions
@c to POSIX system calls and networking, expect, I/O internals and
@c extensions, slib installation, error handling) and Tim Pierce
@c (sections on script interpreter triggers, alists, function tracing).

@c Tom Lord contributed a great deal of material with early Guile
@c snapshots; although most of this text has been rewritten, all of it
@c was important, and some of the structure remains.

@c Aubrey Jaffer wrote the SCM Scheme implementation and manual upon
@c which the Guile program and manual are based.  Some portions of the
@c SCM and SLIB manuals have been included here verbatim.

@c Since Guile 1.4, Neil Jerram has been maintaining and improving the
@c reference manual.  Among other contributions, he wrote the Basic
@c Ideas chapter, developed the tools for keeping the manual in sync
@c with snarfed libguile docstrings, and reorganized the structure so as
@c to accommodate docstrings for all Guile's primitives.

@c Martin Grabmueller has made substantial contributions throughout the
@c reference manual in preparation for the Guile 1.6 release, including
@c filling out a lot of the documentation of Scheme data types, control
@c mechanisms and procedures.  In addition, he wrote the documentation
@c for Guile's SRFI modules and modules associated with the Guile REPL.

@top The Guile Reference Manual

This reference manual documents Guile, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent
Language for Extensions.  It describes how to use Guile in many useful
and interesting ways.

This Info file contains edition @value{MANUAL_EDITION} of the reference
manual, corresponding to Guile version @value{VERSION}.

@chapter Coming Attractions

Where is the rest of the manual?

Good question.  At the time of this writing (2002-05), the rest of
the (very comprehensive) manual is still to be integrated into the
guile-1.4.x distribution.

In the meantime, you can obtain work-in-progress snapshots of the
manual in info and html formats under directory:

@example
http://www.glug.org/docbits/guile-doc-out/
http://www.glug.org/docbits/            (parent has tarballs)
@end example

Keep in mind these snapshots are not necessarily specific to
guile-1.4.x.  As the integration progresses, we expect to mark
version-specific information as such.  (Feel free to suggest to the
guile maintainers which areas need attention.)
