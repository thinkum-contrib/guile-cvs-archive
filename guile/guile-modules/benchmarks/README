This directory contains code for benchmarking Guile.  It's kind of
rough, but I'm learning as I go along...

Before you can run these benchmarks, you'll need to do two steps by hand:
- In the `ports' script, change the #! line at the top to point to the
  Guile executable you want to benchmark.
- In `paths.scm', change the value of benchmark-data-dir to the name
  of the directory containing the files `ports-data-1' and
  `ports-data-2' (this directory).

Ideally, we'd have a `configure; make' arrangement that would do all
this for you, but my first attempt at that doubled the number of files
in the directory, which is kind of offensive, somehow.

See also `../README', which explains how to tell Guile to find the
modules here.
