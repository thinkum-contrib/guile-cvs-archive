This directory contains code for benchmarking Guile.  It's kind of
rough, but I'm learning as I go along...

At the moment, we only have some artificial benchmarks for I/O ports.
If you are interested in contributing new benchmarks, that would be
great.  Send them to guile@cygnus.com, or to me, Jim Blandy
<jimb@red-bean.com>.

To run these benchmarks, you will need a version of Guile more recent
than 5 May 1999 or so --- the tests use the (ice-9 format) module,
which was added to Guile around then.

[cmm] To run the `gc-stress' benchmark, you will need a version of
Guile more recent than 16 Aug 2000 --- this benchmark uses some GC
stats not provided by earlier versions.

Before you can run these benchmarks, you'll need to do two steps by hand:
- In the `run-ports' script, change the #! line at the top to point to the
  Guile executable you want to benchmark.
- Do the same as above with the `gc-stress' script.
- In `paths.scm', change the value of benchmark-data-dir to the name
  of the directory containing the files `ports-data-1' and
  `ports-data-2' (this directory).

Ideally, we'd have a `configure; make' arrangement that would do all
this for you, but my first attempt at that doubled the number of files
in the directory, which is kind of offensive, somehow.

See also `../README', which explains how to tell Guile to find the
modules here.
