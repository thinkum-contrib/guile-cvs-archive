	* goops.scm: New file: Tests for goops.
	(type-dispatch-run): Test for efficiency of type dispatch.

	* lib.scm (save-options, time-in-evaluator, optarg1): New macros.
	(times:format): Added total time.  (This time is actually most
	interesting since it is what finally counts.)
	(times:user, times:gc, times:systen, times:total): New selectors.
	(last-data): New procedure: Return last logged data.
	(time-thunk-median): New procedure: Run five trials and select the
	median.  This filters out outliers caused by temporary
	disturbances and helps select a typical sample.  Since the result
	is displayed for each trial, you also get an intuition for the
	variance.
	(time-thunk-once, time-thunk-median, time-thunk-repeated,
	time-accumulate): Take extra optional argument EVALUATOR.  If
	`debug', use the debugging evaluator.  Default is the normal.

	* ports.scm: Doc fix.
	
	* ports.scm (read-lines): Do one GC before we make any passes,
	rather than doing a GC before each pass.

	* lib.scm: Doc fix.
