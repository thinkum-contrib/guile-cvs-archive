	* gc-stress.scm, gc-stress: new files: stress-testing the GC,
 	useful for comparisons when tweaking the GC.

	* lib.scm (*benchmark-obscure-gc-stuff*): exported variable.  set
 	it to true if you tweak GC.
	(times:gc-mark, times:gc-sweep, times:cells-marked,
 	times:cells-swept): new selectors.
	(general) reorganized times to be an alist -- it's more
 	extendable.
	(times:now): return more stats.
	(times:format): print more things if *benchmark-obscure-gc-stuff*
 	is true.  slightly reorganized.
	(map-cdrs): new procedure, like `map' but expects an alist and
 	maps its function argument over cdrs.
	(times:elapsed, times:add): use `map-cdrs'.

	* eval2.scm: New file: Testing float performance.

1999-12-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* eval1.scm: New file: Testing evaluator performance.

1999-09-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* gc.scm: New file: Testing GC performance.
	(gc-time-run): New test.

	* goops.scm: New file: Tests for goops.
	(type-dispatch-run): Test for efficiency of type dispatch.

	* lib.scm (save-options, time-in-evaluator, optarg1): New macros.
	(times:format): Added total time.  (This time is actually most
	interesting since it is what finally counts.)
	(times:user, times:gc, times:systen, times:total): New selectors.
	(last-data): New procedure: Return last logged data.
	(time-thunk-median): New procedure: Run five trials and select the
	median.  This filters out outliers caused by temporary
	disturbances and helps select a typical sample.  Since the result
	is displayed for each trial, you also get an intuition for the
	variance.
	(time-thunk-once, time-thunk-median, time-thunk-repeated,
	time-accumulate): Take extra optional argument EVALUATOR.  If
	`debug', use the debugging evaluator.  Default is the normal.

	* lib.scm (data-file): Typo.

1999-06-09  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* ports.scm: Doc fix.

	* ports.scm (read-lines): Do one GC before we make any passes,
	rather than doing a GC before each pass.

	* lib.scm: Doc fix.
