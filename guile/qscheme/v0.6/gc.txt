Multi thread gc
===============

When a thread needs a GC:

	- send signal to suspend all other threads.
	- wait for all thread to be stopped:sem_wait(&GC_suspend_ack_sem);
	- make the gc
	- send signal to resume all other threads.


suspend handler for threads:

	* save system sp to SCM_VMD struct
	* sem_post(&GC_suspend_ack_sem);
	* wait for resume
