Before installation
-------------------

To install qscheme you need the following packages:

	* libgmp-2.0.2
	* pcre-3.1
	* ffcall-1.5

If your system does not contain already this packages, please install
them before trying to install qscheme. Don't panic. Installation is
rather simple, just unpack and make and make install. For example:

	tar xvzf libgmp-2.0.2.tar.gz
	cd libgmp-2.0.2
	./configure && make && make install


Compiling QScheme
-----------------

* extract the source package: (if you read this document, you have
alredy complete this stage)

	tar xvzf qscheme-*.tgz

* goto the source directory 

	cd qscheme-*

* configure and compile

	./configure && make

You should see some warnings during compilation of sgtk, don't care
too much about them.

Testing QScheme
---------------

After that, you should be able to run your first test:

	time qscheme < wloop.scm

And compare it to a perl loop:

	time perl -e 'for ($i=0; $i<3000000; $i++) {}'

It should typically be more than 2.5 times faster than perl.

Testing the sgtk extension
--------------------------

Sgtk is a specialized QScheme interpreter containing most of the
binding to the gtk library. This extension is not absolutely tested,
you may have some surprises. Anyway, you should be able to run the
following:

	cd sgtk
	sgtk -i hello.scm
	(hello)

This will open a dialog with 3 buttons, an entry area and a draw
area. The draw area capture the mouse movements, the entry field runs
the qscheme evaluator. Try to type (print "Hello world") in it and
observe what is displayed in your terminal.

If you have libglade (>= 0.12) installed on your system, you should
also be able to try the following:

	make sglade.so
	sgtk -i sconsole.scm
	(start)

Entry in the sconsole window are interpreted when you type ctrl-return.

You may also try to use the mulithreading: simply try this:

	sgtk -i sconsole.scm
	(thread start)

Have fun.
