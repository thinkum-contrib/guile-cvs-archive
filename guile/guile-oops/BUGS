* The recent solution of introducing boundness assertion in the
  getters might not be so good after all.  This only works if slots
  with init-thunks never have a boundchecking getter.

* next-method currently assumes that argument types are the same as
  that for the "parent" method.  Type checking should be introduced
  for the case when the user supplies arguments: (next-method ...)

* Need to check if another thread has already memoized the method
