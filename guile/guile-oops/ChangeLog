	(scm_sys_inherit_magic): Call prep_hashsets.

	* goops.scm (compute-std-cpl): Compute cpl correctly.
	(Topological sort from tiny clos.)

	* goops.c (scm_class_port, scm_class_input_port,
	scm_class_output_port, scm_class_input_output_port): Added.
	(make_standard_classes): Initialize new classes.
	(make_class_from_template): Added.
	(make_extended_class): Use make_class_from_template.
	(local_make_port_classes): Added. Plugs into
	objects.c:scm_make_port_classes.
	(make_port_classes): Make port classes corresponding to all
	existing port types.
	(scm_init_goops): Call make_port_classes.

	* describe.scm: Use Guile's format instead of slib's.

1999-06-24  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj-pc.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm (define-method): Made possible to define setter methods.

1999-06-23  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj-pc.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Added a configure option
	--enable-fdi-example which causes fdi.c to be compiled and linked
	into guile-oops.

	A "foreign data interface" which is supposed to make it easy to
	interface to application data structures has been added.  This is
	very experimental and perhaps not very nice.  I hope that people
	will get better ideas.  :)

	* goops.c (scm_load_goops, scm_make_foreign_object,
	scm_free_foreign_object, scm_make_class, scm_add_slot,
	scm_wrap_object, scm_wrap_component, scm_ensure_accessor,
	scm_add_method): New functions.

	(scm_sys_allocat_instance): Now takes a second arg (just as the
	corresponding method in the MOP).  It is used by
	scm_make_foreign_object.

	(map, filter_cpl, compute_cpl): Better initial approximation to
	cpl computation (we use multiple inheritance already during
	bootstrap).
	(scm_class_foreign_class): New class: The foreign object meta
	class.
	(scm_class_foreign_object): New class: The foreign object class.
	(scm_class_self, scm_class_protected, scm_class_opaque,
	scm_class_read_only, scm_class_protected_opaque,
	scm_class_protected_read_only, scm_class_scm, scm_class_int,
	scm_class_float, scm_class_double): Slot classes.
	
	(scm_sys_prep_layout_x): Largely rewritten: Now uses slot types
	to build the layout.

	(scm_makekey): Removed. (Replaced by scm_c_make_keyword in
	libguile.)

	(scm_basic_basic_make_class): Guts of old scm_basic_make_class
	which has been split in order to be more useful.
	(scm_build_class_class_slots): Build slot definitions for class
	class.  (Torn out of create_basic_classes.)

	* goops.h (SCM_METACLASS_GOOPS_LAYOUT): Noe includes the required
	fields.
	(SCM_CLASSF_FOREIGN): New class flag: Indicates that the instance
	is a foreign object.
	(SCM_IS_A_P): New macro.  Corresponds to the scheme predicate.
	(scm_si_constructor, scm_si_destructor): New slots of foreign
	classes.

	* fdi.c: New file: Foreign data interface example.

	* guile-oops.c: Conditionally use scm_init_fdi.

	* goops-snarf.h: Snarf macros for the foreign data interface.

	* goops.scm (initialize, write-object): New methods for
	<foreign-object>:s.

1999-06-18  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj-pc.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.h (STKLOS_VERSION, scm_stklos_version): Removed.

1999-06-17  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj-pc.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm (add-method!): Made generic => added to the MOP.

1999-06-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj-pc.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm (method): Allow empty method bodies.

	* goops.c (scm_sys_prep_layout_x): Handle empty layouts
	correctly.  (Don't call scm_must_malloc.)
	(scm_sys_allocate_instance): Don't allow empty instances.  (Maybe
	this should be changed.)

1999-04-12  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm (slot-definition-init-value): Renamed from
	slot-definition-init; Replaced #:init keyword with #:init-value.
	(class): Re-introduce #:init-form.

1999-03-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* New libtool: 1.2f
	* ltmain.sh, ltconfig, config.guess, config.sub: New versions.
	* README: Mention new version number of libtool.

1999-03-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c (make_struct_classes): New argument order in
	scm_internal_hash_fold: Moved table argument last.

	* goops.scm (define-class, class): Change in syntax: Removed the
	redundant pair of parenthesis around the slot definitions.  (We
	anyway need to go through the list of slots in both macros, so
	this change in syntax doesn't introduce any extra cost.)

	* active-slot.scm, composite-slot.scm: Changed to new class syntax.

1999-03-19  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm (write-object): New method: More informative printing
	of methods.
	(make-method): Exported.

	* Makefile.am (internal.scm, active-slot.scm, composite-slot.scm):
	Added.
	
	* internal.scm (oop goops internal): New module.  Exports all
	internal bindings in (oop goops).

	* active-slot.scm (oop goops active-slot),
	composite-slot.scm (oop goops composite-slot): New modules.
	Ported from STKlos.

1999-03-18  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm, Makefile.am, goops.c, goops.h, guile-oops.c: Renamed
	module (oop goopscore) --> (oop goops goopscore).
	describe.scm:
	Renamed module (oop describe) --> (oop goops describe).

	* goops.c (create_basic_classes): Renamed from
	create_Top_Object_class.
	(scm_basic_make_class, create_basic_classes): Use maplist.
	(compute_getters_n_setters): Assume alist slot lists.
	(scm_get_keyword): Improved error messages.

1999-03-18  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c (maplist): Utility used to construct slot lists.
	(remove_duplicate_slots, scm_sys_initialize_object): Simplify by
	assuming that slot lists are proper alists.

	* goops.scm (compute-std-cpl): Compute a CLOS-style cpl.
	(define-class): Bugfix: Added `new' as alternative in the
	redefinition condition;
	Added write-object in the print slot of builtin classes
	<operator-class> and <operator-with-setter-class>.

1999-03-16  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.scm (define-class-pre-definition): Bugfix: Pass name to
	accessor constructors.
	(define-class): Skip options with non-symbolic arg, don't
	terminate scan!
	(compute-cpl): Made a generic.

1999-03-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am: oop directory removed.
	* goops.scm, describe.scm: Moved here from old directory oop.

1999-03-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* oop: New directory.  Renamed from goops.

	* Makefile.am: Renamed goops --> oop.

	* oop/goops.scm (make-class): Now demands that slot definitions
	always are lists.  (The `class' macro does the conversion so that
	the user of those macros still can use simple symbols as slot
	definitions.)

	* oop/goops.scm (define-class, class): A major new thing is that
	all slot options are evaluated, i.e. also #:getter, #:setter, and,
	#:accessor options.  Because of this, the corresponding <generic>
	and <generic-with-setter>s must exist before creating the class.
	`define-class' does this automatically if they don't exist
	beforehand.

	* oop/goops.scm (slot-definition-init,
	slot-definition-init-thunk): New selectors for the new slot
	options #:init and #:init-thunk.
	(compute-getters-n-setters): Handle new selectors.
	(slot-definition-init-form): Removed.
	(class-slot-definition): Use assq instead of assoc.
	(slot-definition-init-form): Removed #:init-form alternative.
	goops/goops.scm (initialize <operator-class>): Accept #:procedure
	keyword.

	* oop/goops.scm (method-source): Renamed from method-body;
	Use map* instead of map.
	(is-a?): Use memq instead of memv.
	(map*, for-each*): Moved here from compat.scm.
	
	* oop/goops.scm, oop/describe.scm: Replaced use of when and unless
	everywhere.

	* oop/goops.scm (define-module): Added #:no-backtrace option;
	Set the system-procedure property on apply-generic-<n> in order
	that these should not turn up at the end of backtraces.
	(goops-error): Call `save-stack'.
	
	* goops.c (make_extended_class): New function: Creates wrapper
	classes for smob and struct types.
	(make_smob_classes, make_struct_classes): Creates smob and struct
	wrapper classes upon initialization of Goops.  (Wrapper classes
	continue to be created when new smobs and structs are
	loaded/accessed.)

	* goops.c (scm_make): Set the name property of generics.
	(make_stdcls): Allow for multiple inheritance by passing a list of
	supers as fourth arg.  (Note that the cpl gets screwed up in this
	case and has to be patched.)  This is currently used for
	initialization of <generic-with-setter>.
	(make_standard_classes): Removed `name' slot in <generic>.
	(scm_generic_function_name): Use scm_procedure_name.

	
	New class redefinition protocol: In the old protocol new class
	objects got a new heap header but instances retained their old
	header.  The new protocol keeps the old header also for redefined
	classes.

	* goops.c (TEST_CHANGE_CLASS): Rewritten in order to comply with
	the new class redefinition protocol.
	(SCM_OBJ_CLASS_REDEF): New macro which accesses the `redefined'
	slot via the instance.
	(scm_sys_modify_class): New function.  Swaps headers between two
	class objects.
	
	* oop/goops.scm: Corrected bugs in the class redefinition
	protocol.


	* goops.c: New setter slot in classes:
	(scm_sys_prep_layout_x): Modified class layout.
	(create_Top_Object_Class): setter slot name.

	* goops.h (struct scm_metaclass_goops): New setter slot
	(scm_si_methods): Shifted (to 0);
	Shifted slot numbers.

	* goops.c (scm_class_entity, scm_class_entity_with_setter,
	scm_class_generic_with_setter,
	scm_class_operator_with_setter_class): New basic classes.
	An alternative to <operator-with-setter-class>es would be to turn
	`setter' into a <generic> and create a higher-order method which
	returns the apropriate setter method.  Although this might be neat
	theoretically, I judged it to be too inefficient.  (It doesn't
	seem like a good idea to create a closure for every `set!'
	operation.);
	(make_standard_classes): Initialize
	scm_class_procedure_with_setter.
	(scm_sys_set_object_setter_x): New procedure. Sets setter slot of
	<entity-with-setter>'s or <operator-with-setter-class>es.


	* goops.c (scm_sys_inherit_magic_x): Set struct flag
	SCM_STRUCTF_LIGHT for classes which aren't meta or entity
	classes.  This allows for a much more efficient allocation of
	instances, both with regard to speed and memory.
	(scm_sys_allocate_instance): Use scm_alloc_struct (or
	scm_must_malloc directly for "light" objects) when allocating
	instances.


	* goops/oop (define-accessor): New macro.  Creates a
	<generic-with-setter> with a <generic> as setter.
	(make-accessor, ensure-accessor): New procedures.
	
1999-03-08  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm (class-redefinition): Export.
	(define-generic): Use make-generic.
	(make-generic): New procedure.
	(make-generic-function, ensure-generic-function): Removed.
	(define-generic): Rewritten.
	(define-method): Rewritten.
	(make-method): Now a procedure.
	(ensure-method): Removed.
	(method): Rewritten.
	(add-method!): Renamed from add-method.
	(transform-specializers): Replaces `specializers'.

1999-03-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm (initialize <class>): Convert all slot
	definitions to lists; Simplified code dealing with slot
	definitions throughout since slot definitions can no longer be
	simple symbols.
	(slot-init-function): Only take slot names as second arg.
	(class): New special form.
	(ensure-class): Removed.
	(make-class): Remade into a procedure.
	(define-class): Now uses the procedure `make-class'.

1999-03-01  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* guile-oops.c (inner_main): Renamed
	scm_init_goops_goopscore_module () -->

	mkinstalldirs: New versions from automake-1.4.

	* goops/compat.scm, goops/describe.scm: Renamed goops --> oop.

1999-02-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh: New versions from
	libtool-1.2.

	* goops.c, goops.h (scm_i_get_keyword): Added const.

1999-01-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm: Don't use module (ice-9 setf).

	* goops.c, goops.h, goops/goops.scm: Changed module name from
	(goops *) to (oop *).

1999-01-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c (scm_class_of, CLASS_REDEF): Moved to
	libguile/objects.[hc].

	* goops.h (scm_si_hashsets): New slots.  Hashvalues for fast
	multimethod lookup.

1999-01-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c (scm_init_goops_goopscore_module): Added cast for
	scm_init_goops.

	* goops/goops.scm (change-object-class): Only copy slots with
	instance allocation. (Thanks to Christian Lynbech.)

	* goops.c: Renamed class Xxx --> scm_class_xxx.

	* goops.c, goops.h: Renamed and moved C globals containing basic
	classes to libguile/objects.c; Substituted class flags for object
	flags.
	
	* goops.c (scm_sys_inherit_magic_x): Mask flags with
	SCM_CLASSF_INHERIT.

	* goops.h (SCM_CLASSF_INHERIT): New constant: Selects which flags
	to inherit.

1998-12-20  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.h, goops.c: Renamed classe --> class everywhere.  (ANSI C
	differs between Class and class, so there'll be no conflict.)

	* goops.c (scm_sys_prep_layout_x): Removed label exit_err.
	(scm_basic_make_class): Removed setting of object accessors slot.
	(That slot doesn't exist in Goops.)

1998-12-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.h (scm_si_methods): Changed from 5 to 1.

	* goops.c (make_standard_classes): Remove procedure slots for
	generic functions.
	(scm_sys_prep_layout_x): No special treatment of entity classes
	any longer.

1998-12-21  Christian Lynbech  <chl@tbit.dk>

	* goops/goops.scm (change-object-class): Only copy slot values if
	slot has allocation instance.

1998-12-08  Christian Lynbech  <chl@tbit.dk>

	* goops/goops.scm (change-object-class): Attempt initialization
	from init function even if slot was present (but unbound) in old
	class.

1998-12-05  Christian Lynbech  <chl@tbit.dk>

	* goops/goops.scm: Reexport setf! and setter.

	* goops/goops.scm (compute-slot-accessors): Changed handling of
	:accessor option to use new setf functionality for setter.
	Added import of module (ice-9 setf).

1998-12-04  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm (goops-error): Call scm-error with correct
	arguments.

1998-12-04  Christian Lynbech  <chl@tbit.dk>
 
	* goops/goops.scm (goops-error): New function.
	Changed usage of `error' into `goops-error' to get error message
	formatting and changed directive from "~" to "%".
	
	* goops.h: Added missing prototypes for a nunch of functions.
	Added #include <guile/gh.h>.

	* goops.c (sort_applicable_methods): Initialize `vector' to the
	empty list.
	(scm_sys_prep_layout_x): Removed local variale `layout'.

1998-12-01  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c (apply_generic_0, apply_generic_1, apply_generic_2,
	apply_generic_3): Pass SCM_BOOL_F instead of SCM_UNDEFINED as
	next-method argument.  Otherwise scm_apply will get the wrong
	impression of number of arguments.

1998-11-27  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (subpkgdata_DATA): Added goops/describe.scm.
	Renamed libgoops --> libgoopscore.

	* goops/goops.scm: Use module (goops goopscore).
	(initialize <class>): %inherit-magic! before initializing layout
	slot.
	(initialize <generic>): Let instances of subclasses of <generic>
	use apply-generic.

	* goops.c (CLASSP): Use the metaclass flag to determine if the
	object is a class.  This is faster than looking in the supers
	slot.
	(scm_prep_layout_x): Make procedure slots opaque.
	(scm_basic_make_class): Prep layout *after* inheriting magic, so
	that we can use the flags for information;
	Set the SCM_OBJF_GOOPS flag here.  scm_sys_inherit_magic_x uses it
	for argument checking.
	(scm_class_of): Don't presume that all structs are Goops objects!
	(scm_sys_allocate_instance): Major rewrite of the class/object
	flag logic.
	(scm_make): Use scm_set_object_procedure_x to set the procedures.
	(scm_init_goops): Use a new scheme for loading bindings into the
	same module (goops goops) as the scheme code: We pretend that we
	are the module (goops goopscore) but switch to (goops goops) when
	creating bindings.  (The old scheme had big problems since the
	current module system isn't designed for having both scheme and
	object code in the same module.)

	* goops.h, goops.c: Renamed SCM_OBJF_GENERIC -->
	SCM_OBJF_PURE_GENERIC.
	(SCM_OBJ_FLAGS, SCM_SET_OBJ_FLAGS): New macros.
	(scm_init_goops_goopscore_module): Renamed from
	scm_init_goops_goops_module.

	* guile-oops.c (inner_main): Call scm_init_goops_goopscore_module.

	* goops.h (SCM_INST_TYPE): Use SCM_OBJ_FLAGS.
	(scm_si_print): New slot index.

	* goops/describe.scm: New file.

	* TODO: New file.

1998-11-26  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c (scm_sys_inherit_magic_x): Return SCM_UNSPECIFIED.

	* goops.c, goops.h: Position of procedure slots moved in class
	objects.

1998-11-25  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm: Moved STk compatibility code to
	goops/compat.scm.

	* goops/compat.scm: New file.

	* Makefile.am (subpkgdata_DATA): Added goops/compat.scm.

	* goops.c (Operator_class): New metaclass: This is the class of
	operator classes.  While an entity class keeps its procedure in
	the object itself, an operator class keeps it in the class object.
	(scm_basic_make_class): Set operator class flag for operator
	classes.
	(scm_sys_allocate_instance): Set entity and operator class flags
	for entities (check superclasses too!) and operators.
	(make_standard_classes): Initialize Operator_class.

	* goops/goops.scm (*unbound*, make-unbound, unbound?): Replaced by
	primitives.
	(compute-get-n-set): Use an ordinary scheme variable for slots
	with class and each-subclass allocation.

	* goops.c (SCM_GOOPS_UNBOUND, SCM_GOOPS_UNBOUNDP): New macros:
	Implements an unbound value internal to goops.  We can't use
	SCM_UNDEFINED since that value can't be handled by scheme code;
	Replaced SCM_UNDEFINED --> SCM_UNBOUNDP and SCM_UNBNDP -->
	SCM_GOOPS_UNBOUNDP on suitable places.
	(scm_goops_the_unbound_value): Holds the unbound value.
	(Later we may choose to implement this as an ISYM or for
	efficiency.)
	(scm_init_goops): Initialize the unbound value.
	(scm_make_unbound, scm_unbound_p): New primitives.

1998-11-24  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm: Added <complex> to list of print slot
	initializations.
	(compute-getters-n-setters): Use `(procedure-property <proc> 'arity)'
	instead of `%procedure-arity' in `verify-accessors'.

	* goops.c (scm_class_of): Use TEST_CHANGE_CLASS to check for class
	redefinition if argument is a goops instance.

	* goops/goops.scm (ensure-class): Handle supers passed as
	meta-objects.

	* goops.c (set_slot_value_if_unbound): Apply init closure to an
	empty list, not a list containing an empty list.

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): Do test -r instead of test -e
	in order to be backward compatible.

1998-11-24  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): Don't exit with an error if we
	haven't created libgoops.so.0

1998-11-23  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops/goops.scm: Removed module workaround; Added :use-module on
	the module itself to load object code (which was what the
	workaround did);  Export public primitives defined by the object
	code.

	* goops.h: Added declaration of scm_init_goops_goops_module.

	* goops.c: Use new C level module interface <libguile/modules.h>
	to define and get bindings in the correct module.  (Now the full
	MOP should work!)

	* guile-oops.c: Call scm_init_goops_goops_module instead of
	scm_init_goops in order to postpone module creation until
	requested.
	
	* configure.in: Use aggressive warning messages if CC=gcc.

1998-11-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.c: Added #include <libguile/modules.h>
	(scm_init_goops): Use the new C interface to modules.

1998-11-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): Added: Puts symbolic links to
	the dynamically linked library into the goops module directory.

	* configure.in: Removed unneccesary lines; Added AC_PROG_LN_S.

	* goops/goops.scm: Added workaround so that compiled code and
	interpreted code can coexist in the same module.

1998-11-22  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* goops.h, goops.c: New files.  Port of stklos from STk-3.99.3

	* goops: New directory: Contains the scheme part of stklos.
