Changes since GOOPS 0.1.2:

* Changes to the distribution

** GOOPS 0.1.4 is dependent on Guile version >= 1.3.3

* Changes to Scheme functions and syntax

** A new scheme for "forwarding" calls to a builtin to a generic function

It is now possible to extend the functionality of some Guile
primitives by letting them defer a call to a GOOPS generic function on
argument mismatch.  This functionality is enabled with the GOOPS
primitive

  enable-primitive-generic! PRIMITIVE ...

It is then possible to extend the primitive(s) by defining methods for
them without loss of efficiency in normal evaluation.

Example:

  (use-modules (oop goops))
  (enable-primitive-generic! +)
  (define-method + ((x <string>) (y <string>))
    (string-append x y))

  + will still be as efficient as usual in numerical calculations, but
  can also be used for concatenating strings.

  Who will be the first one to extend Guile's numerical tower to
  rationals?  :)


Changes since GOOPS 0.1:

** Corrected serious bugs in compute-slot-accessors and initialize <class>.
