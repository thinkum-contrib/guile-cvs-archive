.TH GUILE-OOPS 1 "January 2001" Version "1.0"
.SH NAME
guile-oops \- a Scheme interpreter with OOP extensions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B guile-oops [-q] [-ds] [--help] [--version] [--emacs] [--debug]
.B [-l FILE] [-e FUNCTION] [\]
.B [-c EXPR] [-s SCRIPT] [--]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Guile is an interpreter for the Scheme programming language.  It
implements a superset of R4RS, providing the additional features
necessary for real-world use.  It is extremely simple to embed guile
into a C program, calling C from Scheme and Scheme from C.  Guile's
design makes it very suitable for use as an "extension" or "glue"
language, but it also works well as a stand-alone scheme development
environment.

The
.B guile-oops
executable itself provides a stand-alone interpreter for scheme
programs, for either interactive use or executing scripts.  The
executable is linked with the GOOPS library, adding object oriented
programming capabilities to Guile.

This manpage provides only brief instruction in invoking
.B guile-oops
from the command line.  Please consult the guile info documentation
(type 
.B info guile
at a command prompt) for more information.  There is also a tutorial
.B (info guile-tut) 
available and documentation for GOOPS
.B (info goops).

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -l FILE
Load scheme source code from file.
.IP -e FUNCTION
After reading script, apply FUNCTION to command-line arguments
.IP -ds
do -s SCRIPT at this point (note that this argument must be used in
conjuction with -s)
.IP --help 
Describe command line options and exit
.IP --debug
Start guile with debugging evaluator and backtraces enabled 
(useful for debugging guile scripts)
.IP --version
Display guile version and exit.
.IP --emacs
Enable emacs protocol for use from within emacs (experimental)
.IP --
Stop argument processing, start guile in interactive mode.
.IP -c EXPR
Stop argument processing, evaluate EXPR as a scheme expression.
.IP -s SCRIPT-FILE
Load Scheme source from SCRIPT-FILE and execute as a script.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.B GUILE_LOAD_PATH
If
.RB $ GUILE_LOAD_PATH
is set, its value is used to agument the path to search for scheme
files when loading.  It should be a colon separated list of
directories which will be prepended to the default %load-path.

.SH FILES
.I ~/.guile
is a guile script that is executed before any other processing occurs.
For example, the following .guile activates guile's readline
interface:

.RS 4
(use-modules (ice-9 readline))
.RS 0
(activate-readline)

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.B info guile, info guile-tut, info goops

http://www.schemers.org provides a general introduction to the
Scheme language.

.SH AUTHORS
Robert Merkel <rgmerk@mira.net> wrote this manpage.
Mikael Djurfeldt <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se> adapted it for guile-oops.

.B guile-oops 
is GNU software.  Guile is originally based on Aubrey Jaffer's
SCM interpreter, and is the work of many individuals.
