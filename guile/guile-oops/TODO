* Implement top-sort and compute-std-cpl in C, use this during
  bootstrapping and remove Scheme version of compute-std-cpl in
  goops.scm.

* Version information (also from Scheme level).

* Check guile version in configure.in

* Update mop.text

* Test method cache.

* Read and correct documentation.

* Invalidate generic function caches when classes are redefined

* Remove assumption of single-symbol slot definitions from goops.c.

* Fix some *fixme*'s

* Make sure that all of Guile's primitive types are represented in the
  class hierarchy

* README-file with "How to get started"

** Warn that current generic methods aren't tail recursive!

* Introduction to Goops

* Make sure that Makefile.am mentions all files which should go into
  the distribution

* Test that `make dist' yields a nice distribution

* Beta-release Goops 0.9!

* with-slots, with-accessors

* Optimize

** Free-list of next-methods (c.f. print-states in print.c)

** Faster slot access

* Design a new MOP for generic method application

* Implement ditto and optimize!

** New evaluator primitive: SCM_IM_DISPATCH

Self-mutating form which cache type --> method mappings.

This will also make generic methods tail-recursive.
