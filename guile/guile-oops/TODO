* Typed slots

* Add downstream slot to <generic>

* <extended-generic> with upstream slot

* (define-extended-generic NAME #:extend GF1 | (list GF2 GF3))
  <=> (define NAME (make-extended-generic GF1 | (list GF2 GF3)))

* Change generic-function-methods to take upstream/downstream into account

* Ditto for %invalidate-method-cache

* Introduce slot option indicating whether to merge slots or not
  default = don't merge

* Remove slot-ref/set!

* Generate accessor by default.

* Option to prevent accessor

* Implement apply generic protocol

* New class extended-generic with list of generics slot so that we
  refer to generics in other modules instead of copying methods

* New special from for definingextending generics and adding methods?

* Introduce new syntax (define-method (foo ...) ...)
  Announce old syntax as deprecated.

* Extend syntax for `define-generic' so that options can be passed,
  especially the default and setter options.  Then don't let
  define-generic automatically pick up default methods any longer.

* Replace compute-get-n-set

* Method compilation:

  0. expand macros!
  1. accessors --> @slot-ref|set! | proc call
  2. gf --> code-entry | dispatcher
  3. apply gf --> code-entry | dispatcher
  4. next-method call --> code
  5. next-method reference --> add next-method let

  6. with-slots: slot reference --> @slot-ref|set! | proc call
  7. with-accessord: accessor ref --> -- " --

  The following would be necessary to remove overhead for matrix
  setting in (math matrix):

  8. (setter proc) --> proc
  9. (proc exp1 ...) --> proc body if body uses formals once or
exp1 ... are atomic

  NOTE: Use slot types if present.

  10. Mark values as newly created/input.  (A function is functional
      also if it sets a newly created value.)  Mark procedures as
      functional/imperative.  Call functional procedures at compile
      time if their value is a constant.

* scm_slot_SCM in C interfac (make sure that the right mark in the
  layout is set)

* Beware of the next-method dispatch problem!

* with-slots, with-accessors

* Update mop.text

* Optimizations

** Remove assumptions of single-symbol slot definitions from goops.c.

** Implement top-sort and compute-std-cpl in C, use this during
   bootstrapping and remove Scheme version of compute-std-cpl in
   goops.scm.

** Don't call intern repeatedly in goops.c (see e.g. CALL_GF).

*** Don't forget to invalidate generic function caches
when classes are redefined

MDJ 990821 <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se> Why should we do this?

** Strategy for optimization of the MOP

Terminology: Let subprotocol F mean a series of generic function calls
that starts with a call to generic function F in the MOP.

Ex: The apply-generic is a subprotocol that includes
compute-applicable-methods and sort-applicable-methods.

It is possible to have a fairly extensive MOP and yet have an
efficient implementation for the standard case.

Currently, this is the case with the apply-generic protocol: The class
<generic> has the flag SCM_CLASSF_PURE_GENERIC set.  Instances of this
class follow an efficient C level implementation of the apply-generic
protocol, but instances to subclasses of <generic> use the Scheme
level protocol.

Here is a proposal for a different strategy to achieve the same goal:

Let generic functions belonging to a certain subprotocol be instances
to a subclass <SUBPROTOCOL-generic> of <generic>.  The idea is that
the optimized version of the MOP will be used on instances to all
classes which are "pure" with respect the protocol.  The purity is an
inherited property.

But, if the user specializes a function M which is an instance of
<SUBPROTOCOL-generic> to C, C will no longer be "pure".

Example: Let C be a subclass to <generic>.  Normally a function F
which is an instance of C will be applied using the optimized
apply-generic protocol.  But, if the user specializes
compute-applicable-methods to C, C will no longer be "pure" => F will
be applied using the full MOP.

More concretely, we could allocate an inherited class flag which tells
that a GF belongs to SUBPROTOCOL.  There is also a class flag which
tells that a CLASS is "pure" with respect to SUBPROTOCOL.

When the user specializes a function F to a class C, add-method! will
clear the purity flag of C if F has the SUBPROTOCOL flag set.

This could for example be done by always calling a magic function

  %touch F C

when specializing F to C in the first argument.

It is also necessary to pay attention to the positions of slots so
that instances of "pure" classes have slots on the positions where the
optimized protocols expect to find them.

* MOP

** Clean up the MOP with respect to recent changes

** Make no-applicable-method CLOS-like (args)

* Misc

** add compile-method to MOP?

** Class-specific slots: Name: (<class-name> <slot-name>)
   (Maybe special metaclass?)

I stepped down as GOOPS maintainer since I had the intention to quit
working with Guile development.  But since I've changed my mind,
Christian and I decided that I become GOOPS maintainer again.

This means that it is ultimately I and Maciej (since there are plans
to integrate GOOPS with Guile) who ultimately makes decisions about
how to change GOOPS.

I'm saying this with the current GOOPS-module system debate in mind,
because I'd like to guarantee you that we won't make any rash
decisions about GOOPS design in this respect.

I see the current discussion as a useful play with ideas to elucidate
problems in GOOPS and perhaps come up with useful new ideas.  But I
won't include new ideas into GOOPS until I'm sure it is a good move,
and I can tell you we're very far from that.


Still, it is my view that GOOPS has to change further in order to be
more adapted to the nature of Scheme.

While LISP is "centered around" symbols, Scheme is centered around
objects.  Because of this, the GOOPS MOP will change to also be
centered around objects.  E. g., slots will no longer be identified by
a name, but by a slot definition object.

This means that slot-ref/set! *will* be outdated.  (They are going to
be supported in the STklos compatibility module, however.)  I know
that this is a bit controversial, but we have already had a long
discussion about this in the past.  While that discussion didn't end
in consensus, the support for this change was stronger.  After long
consideration, the decision is now made to carry it through.

The canonic way of accessing slots is through accessors.  An accessor
is a generic function with setter with get and set methods for a
particular slot specialized to the class carrying the slot.  (This is
what accessors look like already now.)

P.S. I know that several people are now waiting for me to do things.
     Unfortunately this weekend didn't have as much time for Guile as
     I had wished.  I promise to make efforts to get new Guile time as
     soon as possible.
