* Add sort.c to libguile

* Fix some *fixme*'s

* Make sure that all of Guile's primitive types are represented in the
  class hierarchy

* Convert the code for STk's extended types to support for smobs.

* README-file with "How to get started"

** Warn that current generic methods aren't tail recursive!

* Introduction to Goops

* Make sure that Makefile.am mentions all files which should go into
  the distribution

* Test that `make dist' yields a nice distribution

* Beta-release Goops 0.9!

* Optimize

** Free-list of next-methods (c.f. print-states in print.c)

** Move the guts of scm_make_struct into scm_sys_allocate_instance and
   optimize!

** Faster slot access

* Design a new MOP for generic method application

* Implement ditto and optimize!

** New evaluator primitive: SCM_IM_DISPATCH

Self-mutating form which cache type --> method mappings.

This will also make generic methods tail-recursive.
