	as I go through R4RS and try to complete the gh_ interface.

	Changed @code{struct-vtable-offset} --> @code{vtable-offset-user};
	Added short note about the print call-back initializer.  (This
	section is in need of review.  However, we shoudn't spend much
	time on it since the structs will be replaced by something
	equivalent, but with a different interface.}

Sun Sep 28 00:02:35 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	complete, unless I am completely missing something.

	* scheme.texi (The Guile module system): Added a bit more to this
	chapter, mostly the more user-friendly (use-modules (ice-9
	module-name)) approach.
	(Symbol case): tried to write something about this, but it will
	need to be reviewed by someone who understands the big picture of
	read options.  I also think the section name should be changed to
	something like "Read options".

	* scheme.texi (SLIB): some little details, including splitting off
	what does in the installation chapter.  Also added a section on

 	section to describe getting resources on SCSH, SLIB and Jacal (and
