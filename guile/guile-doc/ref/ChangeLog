1998-10-25  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@barbara.nada.kth.se>

	* gh.texi (C to Scheme, Scheme to C): Completed entries about
	vector conversions.

1998-08-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh.texi (Starting and controlling the interpreter): modified the
	gh_enter() docs in response to some good comments from Dirk
	Herrmann: now they address the issue of loading ice-9/boot-9.scm,
	and include Dirk's hackaround for the problem until we fix it
	properly.

1998-04-29  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* scheme.texi (Dynamic Linking from Marius): added Marius's new
	chapter on dynamic linking; there is still a section in dynamic
	linking (written by Tim maybe?), and I have to examine how to
	resolve that.

1998-03-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* scheme.texi (Port Operations): Changed entry for port-column and
	port-line.  (Thanks to Per Bothner.)

	removal of the (catch #f ...) mechanism.

1998-01-28  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* guile-ref.texi: changed @dircategory to "Scheme Programming".
	It seems to be the consensus.

	* gh.texi (C to Scheme): Added documentation for gh_doubles2scm
	and gh_doubles2dvect.
	(Scheme to C): Added documentation for gh_scm2doubles.

1998-01-15  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* gh.texi (Calling Scheme procedures from C): removed
	gh_make_subr() since Mikael pointed out that it is gone from
	Guile.  I don't remember its history any more, but I don't think
	anyone is missing it.

1998-01-03  Tim Pierce  <twp@skepsis.com>

	(Low level thread primitives): Change with-new-thread to
	call-with-new-thread. 

Sun Dec  7 22:47:22 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* posix.texi (Processes): add "system" procedure.

1997-11-23  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh.texi (Starting and controlling the interpreter): added
	documentation for gh_repl() -- gh_repl() has changed since I saw
	the scm_shell() routine.

1997-11-19  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* scheme.texi (String Fun): New node.
	(Hash Tables): Added `get-handle' and `create-handle!' docs.

	* posix.texi (Networking Databases): Add docs for gethost, getnet,
	getserv, getproto.  Expanded on miscellaneous docs.

	hash tables, and so on).

1997-10-19  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gh.texi (Calling Scheme procedures from C): added many routines
	as I go through R4RS and try to complete the gh_ interface.

Wed Oct  8 04:51:54 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	*  scheme.texi (Dynamic Roots): added batch mode procedures.

1997-10-03  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* scheme.texi (Vtables): Changed 0 --> @code{vtable-index-layout};
	Changed @code{struct-vtable-offset} --> @code{vtable-offset-user};
	Added short note about the print call-back initializer.  (This
	section is in need of review.  However, we shoudn't spend much
	time on it since the structs will be replaced by something
	equivalent, but with a different interface.}

Sun Sep 28 00:02:35 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* scheme.texi (Keywords): very small re-organization to take
	advantage of the fact that read-options is now documented in
	another chapter.

Thu Sep 25 23:37:02 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* scheme.texi (Guile options interface): renamed the symbol case
 	section to "Guile options interface".  "Reader options" is now a
 	subsection of that.  I've finally figured a lot of how options
 	work, thanks to discovering Mikael's comments in options.c and an
 	old note from Mikael to Jim describing it.
	(Guile options interface): reorganized the individual option
 	groups.  This section (on options) of the manual is now reasonably
	complete, unless I am completely missing something.

Wed Sep 24 15:25:03 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* scheme.texi (The Guile module system): Added a bit more to this
	chapter, mostly the more user-friendly (use-modules (ice-9
	module-name)) approach.
	(Symbol case): tried to write something about this, but it will
	need to be reviewed by someone who understands the big picture of
	read options.  I also think the section name should be changed to
	something like "Read options".

Sun Sep 21 18:45:57 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* scheme.texi (SLIB): some little details, including splitting off
	what does in the installation chapter.  Also added a section on
	Jacal, which has some open issues.

	* appendices.texi (Packages not shipped with Guile): added this
 	section to describe getting resources on SCSH, SLIB and Jacal (and
 	who knows what else in the future).

Sat Aug 30 19:31:22 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* scheme.texi (Uniform Array): mention start and end arguments

	Lists, Hash Tables): New nodes.
