@c Jim's notes:

@c Remember to use "subr" whereever appropriate.
@c Actually, use "primitive", not "subr."  Why coin a new term?
@c FIXME: gotta change existing "subr" uses to "Primitive".
@c In my text for the Guile snarfer, I've used the term "subr" to denote
@c a C function made available to the Scheme world as a function.  This
@c terminology is weird, but consistent with the function names and also
@c with Emacs Lisp, which I assume takes Maclisp's lead.

OK, enough is enough.  I can see that I'm not going to be able to fool
you guys.  I confess everything.  You're right.  It all @emph{was} an
evil conspiracy.  There really isn't a shred of merit in Tcl, or C++, or
Perl, or C; there is not a single reason on earth why anyone should use
any of these languages for any programming task.  Scheme truly is the
perfect language that solves every problem and combines the virtues of
every other language.  For years we've been plotting to trick
programmers into using bad languages.  Yes, I mean ``we''.  Many many
people have participated in this sinister plot, including Larry Wall,
Dennis Ritchie, Bill Gates, the Bureau of ATF, most of the LAPD, and
Mark Fuhrman (sorry you guys, but the truth has overwhelmed me so I've
been forced to expose you).  I feel just terrible at how I have set the
programming world back, and I promise to be a good boy from now on.
