an extended version of the Scheme programming language,
as defined in the @cite{Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language
Scheme}, or @dfn{R4RS}.  In addition to the features described in R4RS,
Guile provides the following enhancements:

@table @asis

@item system call access
Guile provides full access to the POSIX system calls.

@item scripting support
To help you write scripts in Scheme, Guile adopts some minor
modifications to the Scheme syntax.  

@end table

That specification is freely available via the
Internet; to get a copy, see @ref{Obtaining and Installing Guile}.



Guile also provides the following extensions to
R4RS:

[FIXME: this is babbling to fill it somewhat; should be reviewed]

The current ``standard'' for the Scheme language is the
@strong{Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme}
(@cite{r4rs}), and it is commonly referred to as R4RS.  Most Scheme
implementations conform to all the required features in R4RS as well as
the optional ones.

But most Scheme implementations go beyond R4RS in some ways, mostly
because R4RS does not give specifications (or even recommendations)
regarding some issues that are quite important in practical programming.

[FIXME: hmm; what else goes in this chapter?  we have chapters for just
about everything.  I'll put a reference to R4RS and leave it.]

The Scheme language implemented in Guile is R4RS compliant, so R4RS is a
valid document describing the basic Guile language.  This part of the
Guile Reference Manual describes the extensions to Scheme provided in
Guile.

@node Block comments and interpreter triggers
@chapter Block comments and interpreter triggers

Guile provides the block comment tokens @code{#!} and @code{!#} to
mark off a block of text that may span several lines.

@example
#! This is an example of a multi-line comment in Guile
   Scheme.  The Guile lexer ignores everything between
   the opening and closing comment tokens, just as if
   each line began with a semicolon.
!#
@end example

Note that the closing @code{!#} token must appear on a line by
itself.  Even excess whitespace on the closing line will cause the
closing token to be ignored.

The @code{#!} block comment is the same as the @code{#!} token
used in Unix to denote an executable shell script.  This is not
entirely accidental; the choice of @code{#!} and @code{!#} tokens
to mark block comments was made in order to facilitate the use of
Guile in writing scripts.  As a result, it is important to follow
the block comment syntax when writing a shell script in Guile;

@cindex modules

[FIXME: somewhat babbling; shoudl be reviewed by someone who understands
modules, once the new module system is in place]

When programs become large, naming conflicts can occur when a function
or global variable defined in one file has the same name as a function
or global variable in another file.  Even just a @emph{similarity}
between function names can cause hard-to-find bugs, since a programmer
might type the wrong function name.

The approach used to tackle this problem is called @emph{information
encapsulation}, which consists of packaging functional units into a
given name space that is clearly separated from other name spaces.
@cindex encapsulation
@cindex information encapsulation
@cindex name space

The language features that allow this are usually called @emph{the
module system} because programs are broken up into modules that are
compiled separately (or loaded separately in an interpreter).

Older languages, like C, have limited support for name space
manipulation and protection.  In C a variable or function is public by
default, and can be made local to a module with the @code{static}
keyword.  But you cannot reference public variables and functions from
another module with different names.

More advanced module systems have become a common feature in recently
designed languages: ML, Python, Perl, and Modula 3 all allow the
@emph{renaming} of objects from a foreign module, so they will not
clutter the global name space.

@node Scheme and modules
@section Scheme and modules

Scheme, as defined in R4RS, does @emph{not} have a module system at all.

Aubrey Jaffer, mostly to support his portable Scheme library SLIB,
implemented a provide/require mechanism for many Scheme implementations.
Library files in SLIB @emph{provide} a feature, and when user programs
@emph{require} that feature, the library file is loaded in.

For example, the file @file{random.scm} in the SLIB package contains the
line
@smalllisp
(provide 'random)
@end smalllisp
so to use its procedures, a user would type
@smalllisp
(require 'random)
@end smalllisp
and they would magically become available, @emph{but still have the same
names!}  So this method is nice, but not as good as a full-featured
module system.

@node The Guile module system
@section The Guile module system

In 1996 Tom Lord implemented a full-featured module system for Guile
which allows loading Scheme source files into private name space.

This module system is regarded as being rather idiosyncratic, and will
probably change to something more like the ML module system, so for now
I will simply descrive how it works for a couple of simple cases.

First of all, the Guile module system sets up a hierarchical name space,
and that name space can be represented like Unix pathnames preceded by a
@key{#} character.  The root name space for all Guile-supplied modules
is called @code{ice-9}.

So for example, the SLIB interface, contained in
@file{$srcdir/ice-9/slib.scm}, starts out with
@smalllisp
(define-module #/ice-9/slib)
@end smalllisp
and the user program can use
@smalllisp
(define-module (guile) :use-module (ice-9 slib))
@end smalllisp

This [FIXME: must say more, and explain, and also demonstrate a private
name space use, and demonstrate how one would do Python's "from Tkinter
import *" versus "import Tkinter"]

@node Exception Handling
@chapter Exception Handling
@cindex Exceptions
@cindex Error Handling

[FIXME: pasted in from Cygnus Guile docs; should be reviewed]

@defun catch key thunk handler
Invoke @var{thunk} in the dynamic context of @var{handler} for
exceptions matching @var{key}.  If thunk throws to the symbol @var{key},
then @var{handler} is invoked this way:

@example
(handler key args ...)
@end example

@var{key} may be a symbol.  In that case, @var{thunk} takes no
arguments.  If @var{thunk} returns normally, that is the return value of
@code{catch}.

Handler is invoked outside the scope of its own @code{catch}.  If
@var{handler} again throws to the same key, a new handler from further
up the call chain is invoked.

If the key is @code{#t}, then a throw to @emph{any} symbol will match
this call to @code{catch}.

Key may also be the value @code{#f}.  In that case, @var{thunk} takes
one argument which will be passed a @dfn{jump buffer object}.  A jump
buffer object may be used as the key argument to @code{throw} to throw
to a specific @code{catch} without an intervening search for a symbolic
key.
@end defun

@defun throw key &rest args ...
Invoke the catch form matching @var{key}, passing @var{args} to the
@var{handler}.  

If the key is a symbol it will match catches of the same
symbol or of #t.

If there is no handler at all, an error is signaled.
@end defun

@defun error msg args ...
Raise an error with key @code{misc-error} and a message constructed by
displaying @var{msg} and writing @var{args}.
@end defun

@defmac false-if-exception expr
Returns the result of evaluating its argument; however
if an exception occurs then @code{#f} is returned instead.
@end defmac

It is traditional in Scheme to implement exception systems using
@code{call-with-current-continuation}, but his has not been done, for
performance reasons.  The implementation of
@code{call-with-current-continuation} is a stack copying implementation.
This allows it to interact well with ordinary C code.  Unfortunately, a
stack-copying implementation can be slow -- creating a new continuation
involves a block copy of the stack.

Instead of using @code{call-with-current-continuation}, the exception
primitives are implemented as built-ins that take advantage of the
@emph{upward only} nature of exceptions.

@defun dynamic-wind in-guard thunk out-guard
All three arguments must be 0-argument procedures.

@var{in-guard} is called, then @var{thunk}, then @var{out-guard}.

If, any time during the execution of @var{thunk}, the continuation
of the @code{dynamic-wind} expression is escaped non-locally, @var{out-guard}
is called.   If the continuation of the dynamic-wind is re-entered,
@var{in-guard} is called.   Thus @var{in-guard} and @var{out-guard} may
be called any number of times.

@example
(define x 'normal-binding)

(define a-cont  (call-with-current-continuation 
		  (lambda (escape)

@node Structures
@chapter Structures

[FIXME: this is pasted in from Tom Lord's original guile.texi and should
be reviewed]

A @dfn{structure type} is a first class user-defined data type.  A
@dfn{structure} is an instance of a structure type.  A structure type is
itself a structure.

Structures are less abstract and more general than traditional records.
In fact, in Guile Scheme, records are implemented using structures.

@end menu

@node  Structure Concepts
@section Structure Concepts

A structure object consists of a handle, structure data, and a vtable.
The handle is a Scheme value which points to both the vtable and the
structure's data.  Structure data is a dynamically allocated region of
memory, private to the structure, divided up into typed fields.  A
vtable is another structure used to hold type-specific data.  Multiple
structures can share a common vtable.

Three concepts are key to understanding structures.  

@itemize @bullet{}
@item @dfn{layout specifications}

Layout specifications determine how memory allocated to structures is
divided up into fields.  Programmers must write a layout specification
whenever a new type of structure is defined.

@item @dfn{structural accessors}

Structure access is by field number.   There is only one set of
accessors common to all structure objects.

@item @dfn{vtables}

Vtables, themselves structures, are first class representations of
disjoint sub-types of structures in general.   In most cases, when a 
new structure is created, programmers must specifiy a vtable for the
new structure.   Each vtable has a field describing the layout of its
instances.   Vtables can have additional, user-defined fields as well.
@end itemize



@node  Structure Layout
@section Structure Layout

When a structure is created, a region of memory is allocated to hold its
state.  The @dfn{layout} of the structure's type determines how that
memory is divided into fields.

Each field has a specified type.  There are only three types allowed, each
corresponding to a one letter code.  The allowed types are: 

@itemize @bullet{}
@item 'u' -- unprotected

The field holds binary data that is not GC protected.

@item 'p' -- protected

The field holds a Scheme value and is GC protected.

@item 's' -- self

The field holds a Scheme value and is GC protected.  When a structure is
created with this type of field, the field is initialized to refer to
the structure's own handle.  This kind of field is mainly useful when
mixing Scheme and C code in which the C code may need to compute a
structure's handle given only the address of its malloced data.
@end itemize


Each field also has an associated access protection.   There are only
three kinds of protection, each corresponding to a one letter code.
The allowed protections are:

@itemize @bullet{}
@item 'w' -- writable

The field can be read and written.

@item 'r' -- readable

The field can be read, but not written.

@item 'o' -- opaque

The field can be neither read nor written.   This kind
of protection is for fields useful only to built-in routines.
@end itemize

A layout specification is described by stringing together pairs
of letters: one to specify a field type and one to specify a field
protection.    For example, a traditional cons pair type object could
be described as:

@example
; cons pairs have two writable fields of Scheme data
"pwpw"
@end example

A pair object in which the first field is held constant could be:

@example
"prpw"
@end example

Binary fields, (fields of type "u"), hold one @emph{word} each.  The
size of a word is a machine dependent value defined to be equal to the
value of the C expression: @code{sizeof (long)}.

The last field of a structure layout may specify a tail array.
A tail array is indicated by capitalizing the field's protection 
code ('W', 'R' or 'O').   A tail-array field is replaced by 
a read-only binary data field containing an array size.   The array
size is determined at the time the structure is created.  It is followed
by a corresponding number of fields of the type specified for the
tail array.   For example, a conventional Scheme vector can be
described as:

@example
; A vector is an arbitrary number of writable fields holding Scheme
; values:
"pW"
@end example

In the above example, field 0 contains the size of the vector and 
fields beginning at 1 contain the vector elements.

A kind of tagged vector (a constant tag followed by conventioal
vector elements) might be:

@example
"prpW"
@end example


Structure layouts are represented by specially interned symbols whose
name is a string of type and protection codes.  To create a new
structure layout, use this procedure:

@defun make-struct-layout fields
Return a new structure layout object.

@var{fields} must be a read-only string made up of pairs of characters
strung together.  The first character of each pair describes a field
type, the second a field protection.  Allowed types are 'p' for
GC-protected Scheme data, 'u' for unprotected binary data, and 's' for
fields that should point to the structure itself.    Allowed protections
are 'w' for mutable fields, 'r' for read-only fields, and 'o' for opaque 
fields.  The last field protection specification may be capitalized to
indicate that the field is a tail-array.
@end defun



@node Structure Basics
@section Structure Basics

This section describes the basic procedures for creating and accessing
structures.

@defun make-struct type tail-elts . inits
Create a new structure.

@var{type} must be a vtable structure (@xref{Vtables}).

@var{tail-elts} must be a non-negative integer.  If the layout
specification indicated by @var{type} includes a tail-array,
this is the number of elements allocated to that array.

The @var{inits} are optional arguments describing how successive fields
of the structure should be initialized.  Only fields with protection 'r'
or 'w' can be initialized -- fields of protection 's' are automatically
initialized to point to the new structure itself;  fields of protection 'o'
can not be initialized by Scheme programs.
@end defun

@defun struct? obj
Return #t iff @var{obj} is a structure object.
@end defun


@defun struct-ref struct n
@defunx struct-set! struct n value
Access (or modify) the @var{n}th field of @var{struct}.

If the field is of type 'p', then it can be set to an arbitrary value.

If the field is of type 'u', then it can only be set to a non-negative
integer value small enough to fit in one machine word.
@end defun



@node  Vtables
@section Vtables

Vtables are structures that are used to represent structure types.
Each vtable contains a layout specification in field 0 -- instances
of the type are laid out according to that specification.  Vtables
contain additional fields which are used only internally to libguile.
The variable @code{struct-vtable-offset} is bound to a field number.
Vtable fields at that position or greater are user definable.

@defun struct-vtable struct
Return the vtable structure that describes the type of @var{struct}.
@end defun

@defun struct-vtable? obj
Return #t iff obj is a vtable structure.
@end defun

If you have a vtable structure, @code{V}, you can create an instance of
the type it describes by using @code{(make-struct V ...)}.  But where
does @code{V} itself come from?  One possibility is that @code{V} is an
instance of a user-defined vtable type, @code{V'}, so that @code{V} is
created by using @code{(make-struct V' ...)}.  Another possibility is
that @code{V} is an instance of the type it itself describes.  Vtable
structures of the second sort are created by this procedure:

@defun make-vtable-vtable new-fields tail-size . inits
Return a new, self-describing vtable structure.

@var{new-fields} is a layout specification describing fields
of the resulting structure beginning at the position bound to
@code{struct-vtable-offset}.

@var{tail-size} specifies the size of the tail-array (if any) of
this vtable.

@var{inits} initializes the fields of the vtable.  Minimally, one
initializer must be provided: the layout specification for instances
of the type this vtable will describe.

@example
;;; loading ,a...
(define x
  (make-vtable-vtable (make-struct-layout (quote pw))
                      0
                      'foo))

(struct? x)

(struct-vtable? x)

@node Conventional Arrays
@section Conventional Arrays

@dfn{Arrays} read and write as a @code{#} followed by the @dfn{rank}
(number of dimensions) followed by what appear as lists (of lists) of
elements.  The lists must be nested to the depth of the rank.  For each
depth, all lists must be the same length.
@example
(make-array 'ho 3 3) @result{}
#2((ho ho ho) (ho ho ho) (ho ho ho))
@end example

Unshared conventional (not uniform) 0-based arrays of rank 1 (dimension)
are equivalent to (and can't be distinguished from) vectors.
@example
(make-array 'ho 3) @result{} (ho ho ho)
@end example

When constructing an array, @var{bound} is either an inclusive range of
indices expressed as a two element list, or an upper bound expressed
as a single integer.  So
@example
(make-array 'foo 3 3) @equiv{} (make-array 'foo '(0 2) '(0 2))
@end example

@defun array? obj
Returns @code{#t} if the @var{obj} is an array, and @code{#f} if not.
@end defun

@defun make-array initial-value bound1 bound2 @dots{}
Creates and returns an array that has as many dimensions as there are
@var{bound}s and fills it with @var{initial-value}.
@end defun

@defun array-ref array index1 index2 @dots{}
Returns the element at the @code{(index1, index2)} element in @var{array}.
@end defun

@defun array-in-bounds? array index1 index2 @dots{}
Returns @code{#t} if its arguments would be acceptable to array-ref.
@end defun

@defun array-set! array new-value index1 index2 @dots{}
Sets the element at the @code{(index1, index2)} element in @var{array} to
@var{new-value}.  The value returned by array-set! is unspecified.
@end defun

@defun make-shared-array array mapper bound1 bound2 @dots{}
@code{make-shared-array} can be used to create shared subarrays of other
arrays.  The @var{mapper} is a function that translates coordinates in
the new array into coordinates in the old array.  A @var{mapper} must be
linear, and its range must stay within the bounds of the old array, but
it can be otherwise arbitrary.  A simple example:
@example
(define fred (make-array #f 8 8))
(define freds-diagonal
  (make-shared-array fred (lambda (i) (list i i)) 8))
(array-set! freds-diagonal 'foo 3)
(array-ref fred 3 3) @result{} foo
(define freds-center
  (make-shared-array fred (lambda (i j) (list (+ 3 i) (+ 3 j))) 2 2))
(array-ref freds-center 0 0) @result{} foo
@end example
@end defun

@defun transpose-array array dim0 dim1 @dots{}
Returns an array sharing contents with @var{array}, but with dimensions
arranged in a different order.  There must be one @var{dim} argument for
each dimension of @var{array}.  @var{dim0}, @var{dim1}, @dots{} should
be integers between 0 and the rank of the array to be returned.  Each
integer in that range must appear at least once in the argument list.

The values of @var{dim0}, @var{dim1}, @dots{} correspond to dimensions
in the array to be returned, their positions in the argument list to
dimensions of @var{array}.  Several @var{dim}s may have the same value,
in which case the returned array will have smaller rank than
@var{array}.

examples:
@example
(transpose-array '#2((a b) (c d)) 1 0) @result{} #2((a c) (b d))
(transpose-array '#2((a b) (c d)) 0 0) @result{} #1(a d)
(transpose-array '#3(((a b c) (d e f)) ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))) 1 1 0) @result{}

@defun enclose-array array dim0 dim1 @dots{}
@var{dim0}, @var{dim1} @dots{} should be nonnegative integers less than
the rank of @var{array}.  @var{enclose-array} returns an array
resembling an array of shared arrays.  The dimensions of each shared
array are the same as the @var{dim}th dimensions of the original array,
the dimensions of the outer array are the same as those of the original
array that did not match a @var{dim}.

An enclosed array is not a general Scheme array.  Its elements may not
be set using @code{array-set!}.  Two references to the same element of
an enclosed array will be @code{equal?} but will not in general be
@code{eq?}.  The value returned by @var{array-prototype} when given an
enclosed array is unspecified.

examples:
@example
(enclose-array '#3(((a b c) (d e f)) ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))) 1) @result{}
   #<enclosed-array (#1(a d) #1(b e) #1(c f)) (#1(1 4) #1(2 5) #1(3 6))>

(enclose-array '#3(((a b c) (d e f)) ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))) 1 0) @result{}
   #<enclosed-array #2((a 1) (d 4)) #2((b 2) (e 5)) #2((c 3) (f 6))>
@end example

@defun array-shape array
Returns a list of inclusive bounds of integers.
@example
(array-shape (make-array 'foo '(-1 3) 5)) @result{} ((-1 3) (0 4))
@end example
@end defun

@defun array-dimensions array
@code{Array-dimensions} is similar to @code{array-shape} but replaces
elements with a @code{0} minimum with one greater than the maximum. So:
@example
(array-dimensions (make-array 'foo '(-1 3) 5)) @result{} ((-1 3) 5)
@end example
@end defun

@defun array-rank obj
Returns the number of dimensions of @var{obj}.  If @var{obj} is not an
array, @code{0} is returned.
@end defun

@defun array->list array
Returns a list consisting of all the elements, in order, of @var{array}.
@end defun

@defun array-copy! source destination
Copies every element from vector or array @var{source} to the
corresponding element of @var{destination}.  @var{destination} must have
the same rank as @var{source}, and be at least as large in each
dimension.  The order is unspecified.
@end defun

@defun serial-array-copy! source destination
Same as @code{array-copy!} but guaranteed to copy in row-major order.
@end defun

@defun array-fill! array fill
Stores @var{fill} in every element of @var{array}.  The value returned
is unspecified.
@end defun

@defun array-equal? array0 array1 @dots{}
Returns @code{#t} iff all arguments are arrays with the same shape, the
same type, and have corresponding elements which are either
@code{equal?}  or @code{array-equal?}.  This function differs from
@code{equal?} in that a one dimensional shared array may be
@var{array-equal?} but not @var{equal?} to a vector or uniform vector.
@end defun

@defun array-contents array
@defunx array-contents array strict
If @var{array} may be @dfn{unrolled} into a one dimensional shared array
without changing their order (last subscript changing fastest), then
@code{array-contents} returns that shared array, otherwise it returns
@code{#f}.  All arrays made by @var{make-array} and
@var{make-uniform-array} may be unrolled, some arrays made by
@var{make-shared-array} may not be.

If the optional argument @var{strict} is provided, a shared array will
be returned only if its elements are stored internally contiguous in
memory.
@end defun

@node Array Mapping
@section Array Mapping

@defun array-map! array0 proc array1 @dots{}
@var{array1}, @dots{} must have the same number of dimensions as
@var{array0} and have a range for each index which includes the range
for the corresponding index in @var{array0}.  @var{proc} is applied to
each tuple of elements of @var{array1} @dots{} and the result is stored
as the corresponding element in @var{array0}.  The value returned is
unspecified.  The order of application is unspecified.
@end defun

@defun serial-array-map! array0 proc array1 @dots{}
Same as @var{array-map!}, but guaranteed to apply @var{proc} in
row-major order.
@end defun

@defun array-for-each proc array0 @dots{}
@var{proc} is applied to each tuple of elements of @var{array0} @dots{}
in row-major order.  The value returned is unspecified.
@end defun

@defun array-index-map! array proc
applies @var{proc} to the indices of each element of @var{array} in
turn, storing the result in the corresponding element.  The value
returned and the order of application are unspecified.

One can implement @var{array-indexes} as
@example
(define (array-indexes array)
    (let ((ra (apply make-array #f (array-shape array))))
      (array-index-map! ra (lambda x x))
      ra))
@end example

@node Uniform Array
@section Uniform Array

@noindent
@dfn{Uniform Array} and vectors are arrays whose elements are all of the
same type.  Uniform vectors occupy less storage than conventional
vectors.  Uniform Array procedures also work on vectors,
uniform-vectors, bit-vectors, and strings.

@noindent
@var{prototype} arguments in the following procedures are interpreted
according to the table:

@example
prototype       type                            printing character

#t              boolean (bit-vector)                    b
#\a             char (string)                           a
integer >0      unsigned integer                        u
integer <0      signed integer                          e
1.0             float (single precision)                s
1/3             double (double precision float)         i
+i              complex (double precision)              c
()              conventional vector
@end example

@noindent
Unshared uniform character 0-based arrays of rank 1 (dimension)
are equivalent to (and can't be distinguished from) strings.
@example
(make-uniform-array #\a 3) @result{} "$q2"
@end example

@noindent
Unshared uniform boolean 0-based arrays of rank 1 (dimension) are
equivalent to (and can't be distinguished from) @ref{Bit Vectors,
bit-vectors}.
@example
(make-uniform-array #t 3) @result{} #*000
@equiv{}
#b(#f #f #f) @result{} #*000
@equiv{}
#1b(#f #f #f) @result{} #*000
@end example

@noindent
Other uniform vectors are written in a form similar to that of vectors,
except that a single character from the above table is put between
@code{#} and @code{(}.  For example, @code{'#e(3 5 9)} returns a uniform
vector of signed integers.

@defun array? obj prototype
Returns @code{#t} if the @var{obj} is an array of type corresponding to
@var{prototype}, and @code{#f} if not.
@end defun

@defun make-uniform-array prototype bound1 bound2 @dots{}
Creates and returns a uniform array of type corresponding to
@var{prototype} that has as many dimensions as there are @var{bound}s
and fills it with @var{prototype}.
@end defun

@defun array-prototype array
Returns an object that would produce an array of the same type as
@var{array}, if used as the @var{prototype} for
@code{make-uniform-array}.
@end defun

@defun list->uniform-array rank prot lst
@defunx list->uniform-vector prot lst
Returns a uniform array of the type indicated by prototype @var{prot}
with elements the same as those of @var{lst}.  Elements must be of the
appropriate type, no coercions are done.
@end defun

@defun uniform-vector-fill! uve fill
Stores @var{fill} in every element of @var{uve}.  The value returned is

@end defun

@defun dimensions->uniform-array dims prototype fill

@defunx make-uniform-vector length prototype fill
@defunx make-uniform-vector length prototype
Creates and returns a uniform array or vector of type corresponding to
@var{prototype} with dimensions @var{dims} or length @var{length}.  If
the @var{fill} argument is supplied, the returned array is filled with
this value.
@end defun

@defun uniform-array-read! ura
@defunx uniform-array-read! ura port
@defunx uniform-vector-read! uve
@defunx uniform-vector-read! uve port
Attempts to read all elements of @var{ura}, in lexicographic order, as
binary objects from @var{port}.  If an end of file is encountered during
uniform-array-read! the objects up to that point only are put into @var{ura}
(starting at the beginning) and the remainder of the array is
unchanged.

@code{uniform-array-read!} returns the number of objects read.

@end defun

@defun uniform-array-write ura
@defunx uniform-array-write ura port

Some of these operations will eventually be generalized to other
uniform-arrays.

@defun bit-count bool bv

@end defun

@defun bit-position bool bv k
Returns the minimum index of an occurrence of @var{bool} in @var{bv}

Modifies @var{bv} by replacing each element with its negation.
@end defun

@defun bit-set*! bv uve bool
If uve is a bit-vector @var{bv} and uve must be of the same length.  If
@var{bool} is @code{#t}, uve is OR'ed into @var{bv}; If @var{bool} is @code{#f}, the
inversion of uve is AND'ed into @var{bv}.

If uve is a unsigned integer vector all the elements of uve must be
between 0 and the @code{LENGTH} of @var{bv}.  The bits of @var{bv}
corresponding to the indexes in uve are set to @var{bool}.

The return value is unspecified.

@node  Shared Substrings
@section Shared Substrings

Whenever you extract a substring using @code{substring}, the Scheme
interpreter allocates a new string and copies data from the old string.
This is expensive, but @code{substring} is so convenient for
manipulating text that programmers use it often.

Guile Scheme provides the concept of the @dfn{shared substring} to
improve performance of many substring-related operations.  A shared
substring is an object that mostly behaves just like an ordinary
substring, except that it actually shares storage space with its parent
string.

@defun make-shared-substring str start [end]
Return a shared substring of @var{str}.  The semantics are the same as
for the @code{substring} function: the shared substring returned
includes all of the text from @var{str} between indexes @var{start}
(inclusive) and @var{end} (exclusive).  If @var{end} is omitted, it
defaults to the end of @var{str}.  The shared substring returned by
@code{make-shared-substring} occupies the same storage space as
@var{str}.
@end defun

Example:

@example
(define foo "the quick brown fox")
(define bar (make-shared-substring some-string 4 9))

foo => "t h e   q u i c k   b r o w n   f o x"
bar =========> |---------|
@end example

The shared substring @var{bar} is not given its own storage space.
Instead, the Guile interpreter notes internally that @var{bar} points to
a portion of the memory allocated to @var{foo}.  However, @var{bar}
behaves like an ordinary string in most respects: it may be used with
string primitives like @code{string-length}, @code{string-ref},
@code{string=?}.  Guile makes the necessary translation between indices
of @var{bar} and indices of @var{foo} automatically.

@example
(string-length? bar) => 5	; bar only extends from indices 4 to 9
(string-ref bar 3)  => #\c	; same as (string-ref foo 7)
(make-shared-substring bar 2)
  => "ick"			; can even make a shared substring!
@end example

Because creating a shared substring does not require allocating new
storage from the heap, it is a very fast operation.  However, because it
shares memory with its parent string, a change to the contents of the
parent string will implicitly change the contents of its shared
substrings.

@example
(string-set! foo 7 #\r)
bar => "quirk"
@end example

Shared substrings are also treated as read-only strings by Guile.  This
is because programmers might not always be aware that a given string is
really a shared substring, and might innocently try to mutate it without
realizing that the change would affect its parent string.

In general, shared substrings are useful in circumstances where it is
important to divide a string into smaller portions, but you do not
expect to change the contents of any of the strings involved.

@node Read Only Strings
@section Read Only Strings

Type-checking in Guile primitives distinguishes between mutable strings
and read only strings.  Mutable strings answer @code{#t} to
@code{string?}  while read only strings may or may not.   All kinds of
strings, whether or not they are mutable return #t to this:

@defun read-only-string? OBJ
Return true of OBJ can be read as a string,

This illustrates the difference between @code{string?} and
@code{read-only-string?}:

@example
(string? "a string") => #t
(string? 'a-symbol") => #f

(read-only-string? "a string") => #t
(read-only-string? 'a-symbol") => #t
@end example
@end defun


"Read only" refers to how the string will be used, not how the string is
permitted to be used.  In particular, all strings are "read only
strings" even if they are mutable, because a function that only reads
from a string can certainly operate on even a mutable string.

Symbols are an example of read only strings.  Many string functions,
such as @code{string-append} are happy to operate on symbols.  Many
functions that expect a string argument, such as @code{open-file}, will
accept a symbol as well.

Another of example of a read-only string is a "shared substring".
Shared substrings are defined in the next chapter.

@node Association Lists
@section Association Lists

[FIXME: while assq, assv and assoc are implemented as per R4RS, all of
the other alist functions have their argument orders in reverse.  This
should surely be changed? -twp]

@defun assq key alist
@defunx assv key alist
@defunx assoc key alist
Fetches the entry in @var{alist} that is associated with @var{key}.  To
decide whether the argument @var{key} matches a particular entry in
@var{alist}, @code{assq} compares keys with @code{eq?}, @code{assv}
uses @code{eqv?} and @code{assoc} uses @code{equal?}.  If @var{key}
cannot be found in @var{alist} (according to whichever equality
predicate is in use), then @code{#f} is returned.  These functions
return the entire alist entry found (i.e. both the key and the value).
@end defun

@defun assq-ref alist key
@defunx assv-ref alist key
@defunx assoc-ref alist key
Like @code{assq}, @code{assv} and @code{assoc}, except that only the
value associated with @var{key} in @var{alist} is returned.  These
functions are equivalent to

@lisp
(let ((ent (@var{associator} @var{key} @var{alist})))
  (and ent (cdr ent)))
@end lisp

where @var{associator} is one of @code{assq}, @code{assv} or @code{assoc}.
@end defun

@defun assq-set! alist key value
@defunx assv-set! alist key value
@defunx assoc-set! alist key value
Reassociate @var{key} in @var{alist} with @var{value}: find any existing
@var{alist} entry for @var{key} and associate it with the new
@var{value}.  If @var{alist} does not contain an entry for @var{key},
add a new one.  Return the (possibly new) alist.

These functions do not attempt to verify the structure of @var{alist},
and so may cause unusual results if passed an object that is not an
association list.
@end defun

@defun assq-remove! alist key
@defunx assv-remove! alist key
@defunx assoc-remove! alist key
Delete any entry in @var{alist} associated with @var{key}, and return
the resulting alist.
@end defun

When using the @var{set!} and @var{remove!} functions, it is often wise
to set the value of the affected alist explicitly to the value returned
by these functions.  Although @code{assq-set!} and family are mutators,
adding or removing an element at the beginning of a list can only be
done by modifying the list's environment frame, which cannot be done by
an ordinary function.

Example:

@lisp
(define capitals '(("New York" . "Albany")
                   ("Oregon"   . "Salem")
                   ("Florida"  . "Miami")))

;; What's the capital of Oregon?
(assoc "Oregon" capitals)       => ("Oregon" . "Salem")
(assoc-ref capitals "Oregon")   => "Salem"

;; We left out South Dakota.
(set! capitals
      (assoc-set! capitals "South Dakota" "Bismarck"))
capitals
=> (("South Dakota" . "Bismarck")
    ("New York" . "Albany")
    ("Oregon" . "Salem")
    ("Florida" . "Miami"))

;; And we got Florida wrong.
(set! capitals
      (assoc-set! capitals "Florida" "Tallahassee"))
capitals
=> (("South Dakota" . "Bismarck")
    ("New York" . "Albany")
    ("Oregon" . "Salem")
    ("Florida" . "Tallahassee"))

;; After Oregon secedes, we can remove it.
(set! capitals
      (assoc-remove! capitals "Oregon"))
capitals
=> (("South Dakota" . "Bismarck")
    ("New York" . "Albany")
    ("Florida" . "Tallahassee"))
@end lisp

Note that the explicit @code{set!} to @var{capitals} turned out to be
unnecessary in two of three instances: the change would have remained in
effect even if @code{capitals} had not explicitly been rebound.
However, it is not practical in general to predict when an explicit
@code{set!} is necessary, so it is often prudent to risk a little
redundancy.

@cindex dynamic roots

A @dfn{dynamic root} is a root frame of Scheme evaluation.
The top-level repl, for example, is an instance of a dynamic root.

Each dynamic root has its own chain of dynamic-wind information.  Each
has its own set of continuations, jump-buffers, and pending CATCH
statements which are inaccessible from the dynamic scope of any
other dynamic root.

In a thread-based system, each thread has its own dynamic root.  Therefore,
continuations created by one thread may not be invoked by another.

Even in a single-threaded system, it is sometimes useful to create a new
dynamic root.  For example, if you want to apply a procedure, but to
not allow that procedure to capture the current continuation, calling
the procedure under a new dynamic root will do the job.

@defun call-with-dynamic-root thunk handler
Evaluate @var{(thunk)} in a new dynamic context, returning its value.

If an error occurs during evaluation, apply @var{handler} to the
arguments to the throw, just as @code{throw} would.  If this happens,
@var{handler} is called outside the scope of the new root -- it is
called in the same dynamic context in which
@code{call-with-dynamic-root} was evaluated.

If @var{thunk} captures a continuation, the continuation is rooted at
the call to @var{thunk}.  In particular, the call to
@code{call-with-dynamic-root} is not captured.  Therefore,
@code{call-with-dynamic-root} always returns at most one time.

Before calling @var{thunk}, the dynamic-wind chain is un-wound back to
the root and a new chain started for @var{thunk}.  Therefore, this call
may not do what you expect:

@example
;; Almost certainly a bug:
(with-output-to-port
 some-port

 (lambda ()
   (call-with-dynamic-root
    (lambda ()
      (display 'fnord)
      (newline))
    (lambda (errcode) errcode))))
@end example

The problem is, on what port will @samp{fnord\n} be displayed?  You
might expect that because of the @code{with-output-to-port} that
it will be displayed on the port bound to @code{some-port}.  But it
probably won't -- before evaluating the thunk, dynamic winds are
unwound, including those created by @code{with-output-to-port}.
So, the standard output port will have been re-set to its default value
before @code{display} is evaluated.

(This function was added to Guile mostly to help calls to functions in C
libraries that can not tolerate non-local exits or calls that return
multiple times.  If such functions call back to the interpreter, it should
be under a new dynamic root.)
@end defun


@defun dynamic-root
Return an object representing the current dynamic root.

These objects are only useful for comparison using @code{eq?}.
They are currently represented as numbers, but your code should
in no way depend on this.
@end defun

@defun quit &opt exit_val
@defunx restart
@defunx abort
Throw back to the error handler of the current dynamic root.

If integer @var{exit_val} is specified and if Guile is being used
stand-alone and if quit is called from the initial dynamic-root,
@var{exit_val} becomes the exit status of the Guile process and the
process exits.

@chapter Regular Expressions

[FIXME: this is taken from Gary and Mark's quick summaries and should be
reviewed and expanded.  Rx is pretty stable, so could already be done!]

@cindex regular expressions
@cindex regex
@cindex rx
@cindex finite automaton

Guile includes an interface to Tom Lord's Rx library (currently only to
POSIX regular expressions).  Use of the library requires a two step
process: compile a regular expression into an efficient structure, then
use the structure in any number of string comparisons.

For example, given the
regular expression @samp{abc.} (which matches any string containing
@samp{abc} followed by any single character):

@smalllisp
guile> @kbd{(define r (regcomp "abc."))}
guile> @kbd{r}
#<rgx abc.>
guile> @kbd{(regexec r "abc")}
#f
guile> @kbd{(regexec r "abcd")}
#((0 . 4))
guile>
@end smalllisp

The definitions of @code{regcomp} and @code{regexec} are as follows:

@deffn procedure regcomp pattern [flags]
Compile the regular expression pattern using POSIX rules.  Flags is
optional and should be specified using symbolic names:
@defvar REG_EXTENDED
use extended POSIX syntax
@end defvar
@defvar REG_ICASE
use case-insensitive matching
@end defvar
@defvar REG_NEWLINE
allow anchors to match after newline characters in the
string and prevents @code{.} or @code{[^...]} from matching newlines.
@end defvar

The @code{logior} procedure can be used to combine multiple flags.
The default is to use
POSIX basic syntax, which makes @code{+} and @code{?}  literals and @code{\+}
and @code{\?}
operators.  Backslashes in @var{pattern} must be escaped if specified in a
literal string e.g., @code{"\\(a\\)\\?"}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure regexec regex string [match-pick] [flags]

Match @var{string} against the compiled POSIX regular expression 
@var{regex}.
@var{match-pick} and @var{flags} are optional.  Possible flags (which can be
combined using the logior procedure) are:

@defvar REG_NOTBOL
The beginning of line operator won't match the beginning of
@var{string} (presumably because it's not the beginning of a line)
@end defvar

@defvar REG_NOTEOL
Similar to REG_NOTBOL, but prevents the end of line operator
from matching the end of @var{string}.
@end defvar

If no match is possible, regexec returns #f.  Otherwise @var{match-pick}
determines the return value:

@code{#t} or unspecified: a newly-allocated vector is returned,
containing pairs with the indices of the matched part of @var{string} and any
substrings.

@code{""}: a list is returned: the first element contains a nested list
with the matched part of @var{string} surrounded by the the unmatched parts.
Remaining elements are matched substrings (if any).  All returned
substrings share memory with @var{string}.

@code{#f}: regexec returns #t if a match is made, otherwise #f.

vector: the supplied vector is returned, with the first element replaced
by a pair containing the indices of the matched portion of @var{string} and
further elements replaced by pairs containing the indices of matched
substrings (if any).

list: a list will be returned, with each member of the list
specified by a code in the corresponding position of the supplied list:

a number: the numbered matching substring (0 for the entire match).

@code{#\<}: the beginning of @var{string} to the beginning of the part matched
by regex.

@code{#\>}: the end of the matched part of @var{string} to the end of 
@var{string}.

@code{#\c}: the "final tag", which seems to be associated with the "cut
operator", which doesn't seem to be available through the posix
interface.

e.g., @code{(list #\< 0 1 #\>)}.  The returned substrings share memory with
@var{string}.
@end deffn

Here are some other procedures that might be used when using regular
expressions:

@deffn procedure compiled-regexp? obj
Test whether obj is a compiled regular expression.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure regexp->dfa regex [flags]
@end deffn

@deffn procedure dfa-fork dfa
@end deffn

@deffn procedure reset-dfa! dfa

@node conventions (includes error handling)
@section conventions (includes error handling)

The low-level interfaces are designed to give Scheme programs access to
as much functionality as possible from the underlying Unix system.  They
can be used to implement higher level intefaces such as the Scheme shell
@ref{The Scheme shell (scsh)}.

Generally there is a single procedure for each corresponding Unix
facility.  There are some exceptions, such as procedures implemented for
speed and convenience in Scheme with no primitive Unix equivalent,
e.g., @code{copy-file}.

The interfaces are intended as far as possible to be portable across
different versions of Unix, so that Scheme programmers don't need to be
concerned with implementation differences.  In some cases procedures
which can't be implemented (or reimplemented) on particular systems may
become no-ops, or perform limited actions.  In other cases they may
throw errors.  It should be possible to use the feature system to
determine what functionality is available.

General naming conventions are as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The Scheme name is often identical to the name of the underlying Unix
facility.
@item
Underscores in Unix names are converted to hyphens.
@item
Procedures which destructively modify Scheme data gain
exclaimation marks, e.g., @code{recv!}.
@item
Predicates (returning only @code{#t} or @code{#f}) have question marks
added, e.g., @code{access?}.
@item
Some names are changed to avoid conflict with dissimilar interfaces
defined by scsh, e.g., @code{primitive-fork}.
@item
Unix preprocessor names such as @code{EPERM} or @code{R_OK} are converted
to Scheme variables of the same name (underscores are not replaced
with hyphens).
@end itemize

Most of the procedures can be relied on to return a
well-specified value.  Unexpected conditions are handled by raising
exceptions.

There are a few procedures which return a special
value if they don't succeed, e.g., @code{getenv} returns @code{#f}
if it the requested string is not found in the environment.  These
cases will be noted in the documentation.

For ways to deal with exceptions, @ref{Exceptions}.

Errors which the C-library would report by returning a NULL
pointer or through some other means are reported by raising a
@code{system-error} exception.
The value of the Unix @code{errno} variable is available
in the data passed by the exception.  Accessing the
global errno value directly would be unreliable due to
continuations, interrupts or multiple threads.

@node ports vs. file descriptors
@section ports vs. file descriptors

Conventions largely follow those of scsh, @ref{The Scheme shell (scsh)}.

Guile ports are currently based on C stdio streams.  Ports can be
buffered or unbuffered.  Unbuffered ports can be specified by including
@code{0} in a port mode string.  Note that some system call interfaces
(e.g., @code{recv!}) will accept ports as arguments, but
will actually operate directly on the file descriptor underlying the
port.  Any port buffering is ignored, including the one character buffer
used to implement @code{peek-char} and @code{unread-char}.

File descriptors are generally not useful for Scheme programs; however
they can be needed when interfacing with foreign code and the Unix
environment.

A file descriptor can be extracted from a port and later converted
back to a port.  However a file descriptor
is just an integer, and the garbage collector doesn't recognise it
as a reference to the port.  If all other references to the port were
dropped, then it's likely that the garbage collector would free
the port, with the side-effect of closing the file descriptor
prematurely.

To assist the programmer in avoiding this problem,
each port has an associated "revealed count" which can be used to keep
track of how many times the underlying file descriptor has been stored
in other places.  The
idea is for the programmer to ensure that the revealed count will be
greater than zero if the file descriptor is needed elsewhere.

For the simple case where a file descriptor is "imported"
once to become a port, it does not matter if the file descriptor
is closed when the port is garbage collected.  There is
no need to maintain a revealed count.  Likewise when "exporting"
a file descriptor to the external environment, setting the revealed count
is not required if the port is kept open while the file descriptor
is in use.

To correspond with traditional Unix behaviour, the three file
descriptors (0, 1 and 2) are automatically imported when a program
starts up and assigned to the initial values of the current input,
output and error ports.  The revealed count for each is initially set to
one, so that dropping references to one of these ports will not result
in its garbage collection: it could be retrieved with fdopen or
fdes->ports.

@deffn procedure port-revealed port
Returns the revealed count for @var{port}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure set-port-revealed! port count
Sets the revealed count for a port to a given value.  The return value
is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure fileno port
Returns the integer file descriptor underlying @var{port} without
changing its revealed count.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure port->fdes port
Returns the integer file descriptor underlying @var{port}.  As a
side effect the revealed count of @var{port} is incremented.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure fdopen fdes modes
Returns a new port based on the file descriptor @var{fdes} with
modes given by the string @var{modes}.  The revealed count of the port
is initialized to zero.  The modes string is the same as that accepted
by @code{open-file}.
@end deffn

@defun fdes->ports fdes
Returns a list of existing ports which have @var{fdes} as an
underlying file descriptor, without changing their revealed counts.
@end defun

@defun fdes->inport fdes
Returns an existing input port which has @var{fdes} as its underlying file
descriptor, if one exists, without changing its revealed count.
Otherwise, returns a new input port created with
fdopen and sets its revealed count to 1.
@end defun

@defun fdes->outport fdes
Returns an existing output port which has @var{fdes} as its underlying file
descriptor, if one exists, without changing its revealed count.
Otherwise, returns a new output port created with
fdopen and sets its revealed count to 1.
@end defun

@defun primitive-move->fdes port fdes
Moves the underlying file descriptor for @var{port} to the integer
value @var{fdes} without changing the revealed count of @var{port}.
Any other ports
already using this descriptor will be automatically
shifted to new descriptors and their revealed counts reset to zero.
The return value is zero if the file descriptor does not need to be
moved or one if it does.
@end defun

@deffn procedure move->fdes port fd
Moves the underlying file descriptor for @var{port} to the integer
value @var{fdes} and sets its revealed count to one.  Any other ports
already using this descriptor will be automatically
shifted to new descriptors and their revealed counts reset to zero.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure release-port-handle port
Decrements the revealed count for a port.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure pipe
Creates a pipe which can be used for communication.  The return value
is a pair in which the CAR contains an input port and the CDR an
output port.  Data written to the output port can be read from the
input port.  Note that both ports are buffered so it may be necessary
to flush the output port before data will actually be sent across the pipe.
Alternatively a new unbuffered output port can be created using
@code{duplicate-port} with an appropriate mode string.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure duplicate-port port modes
Returns a new port which is opened on a duplicate of the file
descriptor underlying @var{port}, with mode string @var{modes}
as for @code{open-file}.  The two ports
will share a file position and file status flags.

Unexpected behaviour can result if both ports are subsequently used
and the original and/or duplicate ports are buffered.
The mode string can include @code{0} to obtain an unbuffered duplicate
port.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure redirect-port old-port new-port
This procedure takes two ports and duplicates the underlying file
descriptor from @var{old-port} into @var{new-port}.  The
current file descriptor in @var{new-port} will be closed.
After the redirection the two ports will share a file position
and file status flags.

The return value is unspecified.

Unexpected behaviour can result if both ports are subsequently used
and the original and/or duplicate ports are buffered.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure port-mode port
Returns the port modes associated with the open port @var{port}.  These
will not necessarily be identical to the modes used when the port was
opened, since modes such as "append" which are used only during
port creation are not retained.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure close-all-ports-except port @dots{}
Close all open file ports used by the interpreter
except for those supplied as arguments.  This procedure
is intended to be used before an exec call to close file descriptors
which are not needed in the new process.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure freopen filename modes port
Reopen @var{port} on the specified @var{filename}
with mode string @var{modes} as for @code{open-file}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure select reads writes excepts [secs] [usecs]
@var{reads}, @var{writes} and @var{excepts} can be lists or vectors: it
doesn't matter which, but the corresponding object returned will be
of the same type.
Each element is a port or file descriptor on which to wait for
readability, writeability
or exceptional conditions respectively.  @var{secs} and @var{usecs}
optionally specify a timeout: @var{secs} can be specified alone, as
either an integer or a real number, or both @var{secs} and @var{usecs}
can be specified as integers, in which case @var{usecs} is an additional
timeout expressed in microseconds.

Buffered input or output data is (currently, but this will change)
ignored: select uses the underlying file descriptor of a port
(@code{char-ready?} will check input buffers, output buffers are
problematic).

The return value is a list of subsets of the input lists or vectors for
which the requested condition has been met.

It is not quite compatible with scsh's select: scsh checks port buffers,
doesn't accept input lists or a microsecond timeout, returns multiple
values instead of a list and has an additional select! interface.
@end deffn

@node file system (mknod goes here no?)
@section file system (mknod goes here no?)

[FIXME: must grab stuff from Gary's misc. section]

These procedures allow querying and setting file system attributes
(such as owner,
permissions, sizes and types of files); deleting, copying, renaming and
linking files; creating and removing directories and querying their
contents; syncing the file system and creating special files.

@deffn procedure access? path how
Returns @code{#t} if @var{path} corresponds to an existing
file and the current process
has the type of access specified by @var{how}, otherwise 
@code{#f}.
@var{how} should be specified
using the values of the variables listed below.  Multiple values can
be combined using a bitwise or, in which case @code{#t} will only
be returned if all accesses are granted.

Permissions are checked using the real id of the current process,
not the effective id, although it's the effective id which determines
whether the access would actually be granted.

@defvar R_OK
test for read permission.
@end defvar
@defvar W_OK
test for write permission.
@end defvar
@defvar X_OK
test for execute permission.
@end defvar
@defvar F_OK
test for existence of the file.
@end defvar
@end deffn

@findex fstat
@deffn procedure stat obj
Returns an object containing various information
about the file determined by @var{obj}.
@var{obj} can be a string containing a file name or a port or integer file
descriptor which is open on a file (in which case @code{fstat} is used
as the underlying system call).

The object returned by @code{stat} can be passed as a single parameter
to the following procedures, all of which return integers:

@table @code
@item stat:dev
The device containing the file.
@item stat:ino
The file serial number, which distinguishes this file from all other
files on the same device.
@item stat:mode
The mode of the file.  This includes file type information
and the file permission bits.  See @code{stat:type} and @code{stat:perms}
below.
@item stat:nlink
The number of hard links to the file.
@item stat:uid
The user ID of the file's owner.
@item stat:gid
The group ID of the file.
@item stat:rdev
Device ID; this entry is defined only for character or block
special files.
@item stat:size
The size of a regular file in bytes.
@item stat:atime
The last access time for the file.
@item stat:mtime
The last modification time for the file.
@item stat:ctime
The last modification time for the attributes of the file.
@item stat:blksize
The optimal block size for reading or writing the file, in bytes.
@item stat:blocks
The amount of disk space that the file occupies measured in units of
512 byte blocks.
@end table

In addition, the following procedures return the information
from stat:mode in a more convenient form:

@table @code
@item stat:type
A symbol representing the type of file.  Possible values are
regular, directory, symlink, block-special, char-special,
fifo, socket and unknown
@item stat:perms
An integer representing the access permission bits.
@end table
@end deffn

@deffn procedure lstat path
Similar to @code{stat}, but does not follow symbolic links, i.e.,
it will return information about a symbolic link itself, not the 
file it points to.  @var{path} must be a string.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure readlink path
Returns the value of the symbolic link named by
@var{path} (a string), i.e., the
file that the link points to.
@end deffn

@findex fchown
@findex lchown
@deffn procedure chown path owner group
Change the ownership and group of the file specified by @var{path} to
the integer userid values @var{owner} and @var{group}.  The return value
is unspecified.  If @var{path} is a symbolic link, either the
ownership of the link or the ownership of the referenced file will be
changed depending on the system (fchown and lchown are
unsupported at present).
@end deffn

@findex fchmod
@deffn procedure chmod obj mode
Changes the permissions of the file referred to by @var{obj}.
@var{obj} can be a string containing a file name or a port or integer file
descriptor which is open on a file (in which case @code{fchmod} is used
as the underlying system call).
@var{mode} specifies
the new permissions as a decimal number, e.g., @code{(chmod "foo" #o755)}.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure utime path [actime] [modtime]
@code{utime} sets the access and modification times for
the file named by @var{path}.  If @var{actime} or @var{modtime}
is not supplied, then the current time is used.
@var{actime} and @var{modtime}
must be integer time values as returned by the @code{current-time}
procedure.

E.g.,

@smalllisp
(utime "foo" (- (current-time) 3600))
@end smalllisp

will set the access time to one hour in the past and the modification
time to the current time.
@end deffn

@findex unlink
@deffn procedure delete-file path
Deletes (or "unlinks") the file specified by @var{path}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure copy-file path-from path-to
Copy the file specified by @var{path-from} to @var{path-to}.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure rename-file path-from path-to
Renames the file specified by @var{path-from} to @var{path-to}.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

the process has appropriate privileges.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure seteuid id

system supports effective IDs.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure setegid id
Sets the effective group ID to the integer @var{id}, provided the process
has appropriate privileges.  If effective IDs are not supported, the
real ID is set instead -- @code{(feature? 'EIDs)} reports whether the

@var{sig} should be specified using a variable corresponding to
the Unix symbolic name, e.g.,

@defvar SIGHUP
Hang-up signal.
@end defvar

@defvar SIGINT
Interrupt signal.
@end defvar
@end deffn

@deffn procedure waitpid pid [options]
This procedure collects status information from a child process which
has terminated or (optionally) stopped.  Normally it will
suspend the calling process until this can be done.  If more than one
child process is eligible then one will be chosen by the operating system.

The value of @var{pid} determines the behaviour:

@table @r
@item @var{pid} greater than 0
Request status information from the specified child process.
@item @var{pid} equal to -1 or WAIT_ANY
Request status information for any child process.
@item @var{pid} equal to 0 or WAIT_MYPGRP
Request status information for any child process in the current process
group.
@item @var{pid} less than -1
Request status information for any child process whose process group ID
is -@var{PID}.
@end table

The @var{options} argument, if supplied, should be the bitwise OR of the
values of zero or more of the following variables:

@defvar WNOHANG
Return immediately even if there are no child processes to be collected.
@end defvar

@defvar WUNTRACED
Report status information for stopped processes as well as terminated
processes.
@end defvar

The return value is a pair containing:

@enumerate
@item
The process ID of the child process, or 0 if @code{WNOHANG} was
specified and no process was collected.
@item
The integer status value.
@end enumerate
@end deffn

The following three
functions can be used to decode the process status code returned
by @code{waitpid}.

@deffn procedure status:exit-val status
Returns the exit status value, as would be
set if a process ended normally through a
call to @code{exit} or @code{_exit}, if any, otherwise @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure status:term-sig status
Returns the signal number which terminated the
process, if any, otherwise @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure status:stop-sig status
Returns the signal number which stopped the
process, if any, otherwise @code{#f}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure execl path [arg] ...
Executes the file named by @var{path} as a new process image.
The remaining arguments are supplied to the process; from a C program
they are accessable as the @code{argv} argument to @code{main}.
Conventionally the first @var{arg} is the same as @var{path}.
All arguments must be strings.  

If @var{arg} is missing, @var{path} is executed with a null
argument list, which may have system-dependent side-effects.

This procedure is currently implemented using the @code{execv} system
call, but we call it @code{execl} because of its Scheme calling interface.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure execlp filename [arg] ...
Similar to @code{execl}, except that if
@var{filename} does not contain a slash
it will be sought for in the
directories listed in the @code{PATH} environment variable.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure primitive-fork
Creates a new "child" process by duplicating the current "parent" process.
In the child the return value is 0.  In the parent the return value is
the integer process ID of the child.

This procedure has been renamed from @code{fork} to avoid a naming conflict
with the scsh fork.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure getenv name
Looks up the string @var{name} in the current environment.  The return
value is @code{#f} unless a string of the form @code{NAME=VALUE} is
found, in which case the string @code{VALUE} is
returned.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure putenv string
Modifies the environment of the current process, which is
also the default environment inherited by child processes.

If @var{string} is of the form @code{NAME=VALUE} then it will be written
directly into the environment, replacing any existing variable with
name matching @code{NAME}.  If @var{string} does not contain an equal
sign, then any existing variable with name matching @var{string} will
be removed.

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure environ [env]
If @var{env} is omitted, returns the current environment as a list of strings.
Otherwise it sets the current environment, which is also the
default environment for child processes, to the supplied list of strings.
Each member of @var{env} should be of the form
@code{NAME=VALUE} and values of @code{NAME} should not be duplicated.
If @var{env} is supplied then the return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure nice incr
Increment the priority of the current process by @var{incr}.  A higher
priority value means that the process runs less often.
The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@node terminals and pseudo-terminals

@deffn procedure ttyname port
Returns a string with the name of the serial terminal device underlying
@var{port}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure ctermid
Returns a string containing the file name of the controlling terminal
for the current process.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure tcgetpgrp port
Returns the process group ID of the foreground
process group associated with the terminal open on the file descriptor
underlying @var{port}.

If there is no foreground process group, the return value is a
number greater than 1 that does not match the process group ID
of any existing process group.  This can happen if all of the
processes in the job that was formerly the foreground job have
terminated, and no other job has yet been moved into the
foreground.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure tcsetpgrp port pgid
Set the foreground process group ID for the terminal used by the file
descriptor underlying @var{port} to the integer @var{pgid}.
The calling process
must be a member of the same session as @var{pgid} and must have the same
controlling terminal.  The return value is unspeficied.
@end deffn

@node pipes
@section pipes

[FIXME: must grab stuff from Gary's misc. section]

These procedures provide an interface to the @code{popen} and 
@code{pclose} system routines.

@findex popen
@deffn procedure open-pipe command modes
Executes the shell command @var{command} (a string) in a subprocess.
A pipe to the process is created and returned.  @var{modes} specifies
whether an input or output pipe to the process is created: it should 
be the value of @code{OPEN_READ} or @code{OPEN_WRITE}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure open-input-pipe command
Equivalent to @code{(open-pipe command OPEN_READ)}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure open-output-pipe command
Equivalent to @code{(open-pipe command OPEN_WRITE)}.
@end deffn

@findex pclose
@deffn procedure close-pipe port
Closes the pipe created by @code{open-pipe}, then waits for the process
to terminate and returns its status value, as for the @code{system}
procedure.

@code{close-port} can also be used to close a pipe, but doesn't return
the status.

@node Networking Databases
@subsection Networking Databases

This section describes procedures which convert internet addresses
and query various network databases.  Care should be taken when using
the database routines since they are not reentrant.

@node Network sockets
@subsection Network sockets

Socket ports can be created using @code{socket} and @code{socketpair}. 
The ports are initially unbuffered, to
makes reading and writing to the same port more reliable.  Buffered
ports can be obtained with
@code{duplicate-port}, @xref{ports vs. file descriptors}.

These procedures convert Internet addresses
and port values between "host" order and "network" order as required.  The
arguments and return values should be in "host" order.

@deffn procedure socket family style protocol
Returns a new socket port of the type specified by @var{family}, @var{style}
and @var{protocol}.  All three parameters are integers.  Typical values
for @var{family} are the values of @code{AF_UNIX}
and @code{AF_INET}.  Typical values for @var{style} are
the values of @code{SOCK_STREAM}, @code{SOCK_DGRAM} and @code{SOCK_RAW}.

@var{protocol} can be obtained from a protocol name using
@code{getprotobyname}.  A value of
zero specifies the default protocol, which is usually right.

A single socket port cannot by used for communication until
it has been connected to another socket.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure socketpair family style protocol
Returns a pair of connected (but unnamed) socket ports of the type specified
by @var{family}, @var{style} and @var{protocol}.
Many systems support only
socket pairs of the @code{AF_UNIX} family.  Zero is likely to be
the only meaningful value for @var{protocol}.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure getsockopt socket level optname
Returns the value of a particular socket option for the socket
port @var{socket}.  @var{level} is an integer code for type of option
being requested, e.g., @code{SOL_SOCKET} for socket-level options.
@var{optname} is an
integer code for the option required and should be specified using one of
the symbols @code{SO_DEBUG}, @code{SO_REUSEADDR} etc.

The returned value is typically an integer but @code{SO_LINGER} returns a
pair of integers.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure setsockopt socket level optname value
Sets the value of a particular socket option for the socket
port @var{socket}.  @var{level} is an integer code for type of option
being set, e.g., @code{SOL_SOCKET} for socket-level options.
@var{optname} is an
integer code for the option to set and should be specified using one of
the symbols @code{SO_DEBUG}, @code{SO_REUSEADDR} etc.
@var{value} is the value to which the option should be set.  For
most options this must be an integer, but for @code{SO_LINGER} it must
be a pair.

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure shutdown socket how
Sockets can be closed simply by using @code{close-port}. The
@code{shutdown} procedure allows reception or tranmission on a
connection to be shut down individually, according to the parameter
@var{how}:

@table @asis
@item 0
Stop receiving data for this socket.  If further data arrives,  reject it.
@item 1
Stop trying to transmit data from this socket.  Discard any
data waiting to be sent.  Stop looking for acknowledgement of
data already sent; don't retransmit it if it is lost.
@item 2
Stop both reception and transmission.
@end table

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure connect socket family address [arg ...]
Initiates a connection from @var{socket} to the address
specified by @var{address} and possibly @var{arg @dots{}}.  The format
required for @var{address}
and @var{arg} @dots{} depends on the family of the socket.

For a socket of family @code{AF_UNIX},
only @code{address} is specified and must be a string with the
filename where the socket is to be created.

For a socket of family @code{AF_INET},
@code{address} must be an integer Internet host address and @var{arg} @dots{}
must be a single integer port number.

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure bind socket family address arg ...
Assigns an address to the socket port @var{socket}.
Generally this only needs to be done for server sockets,
so they know where to look for incoming connections.  A socket
without an address will be assigned one automatically when it
starts communicating.

The format of @var{address} and @var{ARG} @dots{} depends on the family
of the socket.

For a socket of family @code{AF_UNIX}, only @var{address}
is specified and must 
be a string with the filename where the socket is to be created.

For a socket of family @code{AF_INET}, @var{address} must be an integer
Internet host address and @var{arg} @dots{} must be a single integer
port number.

The values of the following variables can also be used for @var{address}:

@defvar INADDR_ANY
Allow connections from any address.
@end defvar

@defvar INADDR_LOOPBACK
The address of the local host using the loopback device.
@end defvar

@defvar INADDR_BROADCAST
The broadcast address on the local network.
@end defvar

@defvar INADDR_NONE
No address.
@end defvar

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure listen socket backlog
This procedure enables @var{socket} to accept connection
requests.  @var{backlog} is an integer specifying
the maximum length of the queue for pending connections.
If the queue fills, new clients will fail to connect until the
server calls @code{accept} to accept a connection from the queue.

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure accept socket
Accepts a connection on a bound, listening socket @var{socket}.  If there
are no pending connections in the queue, it waits until
one is available unless the non-blocking option has been set on the
socket.

The return value is a
pair in which the CAR is a new socket port for the connection and
the CDR is an object with address information about the client which
initiated the connection.

If the address is not available then the CDR will be an empty vector.

@var{socket} does not become part of the
connection and will continue to accept new requests.
@end deffn

The following functions take a socket address object, as returned
by @code{accept} and other procedures, and return a selected component.

@table @code
@item sockaddr:fam
The socket family, typically equal to the value of @code{AF_UNIX} or
@code{AF_INET}.
@item sockaddr:path
If the socket family is @code{AF_UNIX}, returns the path of the
filename the socket is based on.
@item sockaddr:addr
If the socket family is @code{AF_INET}, returns the Internet host
address.
@item sockaddr:port
If the socket family is @code{AF_INET}, returns the Internet port
number.
@end table

@deffn procedure getsockname socket
Returns the address of @var{socket}, in the same form as the object
returned by @code{accept}.  On many systems the address of a socket
in the @code{AF_FILE} namespace cannot be read.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure getpeername socket
Returns the address of the socket that the socket @var{socket} is connected to,
in the same form as the object
returned by @code{accept}.  On many systems the address of a socket
in the @code{AF_FILE} namespace cannot be read.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure recv! socket buf [flags]
Receives data from the socket port @var{socket}.  @var{socket} must already
be bound to the address from which data is to be received.
@var{buf} is a string into which
the data will be written.  The size of @var{buf} limits the amount of
data which can be received: in the case of packet
protocols, if a packet larger than this limit is encountered then some data
will be irrevocably lost.

The optional @var{flags} argument is a value or
bitwise OR of MSG_OOB, MSG_PEEK, MSG_DONTROUTE etc.

The value returned is the number of bytes read from the socket.

Note that the data is read directly from the socket file descriptor:
any unread buffered port data is ignored.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure send socket message [flags]
Transmits the string @var{message} on the socket port @var{socket}. 
@var{socket} must already be bound to a destination address.  The
value returned is the number of bytes transmitted -- it's possible for
this to be less than the length of @var{message} if the socket is
set to be non-blocking.  The optional @var{flags} argument is a value or
bitwise OR of MSG_OOB, MSG_PEEK, MSG_DONTROUTE etc.

Note that the data is written directly to the socket file descriptor:
any unflushed buffered port data is ignored.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure recvfrom! socket buf [flags] [start] [end]
Returns data from the socket port @var{socket} and also information about
where the data was received from.  @var{socket} must already
be bound to the address from which data is to be received.
@code{buf}, is a string into which
the data will be written.  The size of @var{buf} limits the amount of
data which can be received: in the case of packet
protocols, if a packet larger than this limit is encountered then some data
will be irrevocably lost.

The optional @var{flags} argument is a value or
bitwise OR of MSG_OOB, MSG_PEEK, MSG_DONTROUTE etc.

The value returned is a pair: the CAR is the number of bytes read from
the socket and the CDR an address object in the same form as returned by
@code{accept}.

The @var{start} and @var{end} arguments specify a substring of @var{buf}
to which the data should be written.

Note that the data is read directly from the socket file descriptor:
any unread buffered port data is ignored.
@end deffn

@deffn procedure sendto socket message family address arg ... [flags]
Transmits the string @var{message} on the socket port @var{socket}.  The
destination address is specified using the @var{family}, @var{address} and
@var{arg} arguments, in a similar way to the @code{connect}
procedure.  The
value returned is the number of bytes transmitted -- it's possible for
this to be less than the length of @var{message} if the socket is
set to be non-blocking.  The optional @var{flags} argument is a value or
bitwise OR of MSG_OOB, MSG_PEEK, MSG_DONTROUTE etc.

Note that the data is written directly to the socket file descriptor:
any unflushed buffered port data is ignored.
@end deffn

@node system identification (uname)
@section system identification (uname)

@deffn procedure uname
Returns an object with some information about the computer system the
program is running on.
@end deffn

The following procedures accept an object as returned by @code{uname}
and return a selected component.

@table @code
@item utsname:sysname
The name of the operating system.
@item utsname:nodename
The network name of the computer.
@item utsname:release
The current release level of the operating system implementation.
@item utsname:version
The current version level within the release of the operating system.
@item utsname:machine
A description of the hardware.
@end table

@node locales (setlocale)
@section locales (setlocale)

--- Note that there is no more 'misc'.  It's better to have
    small sections than unhelpful names.

@deffn procedure setlocale category [locale]
If @var{locale} is omitted, returns the current value of the specified
locale category 
as a system-dependent string.
@var{category} should be specified using the values @code{LC_COLLATE},
@code{LC_ALL} etc.

Otherwise the specified locale category is set to
the string @var{locale}
and the new value is returned as a system-dependent string.  If @var{locale}
is an empty string, the locale will be set using envirionment variables.
@end deffn

@node expect
@section expect

Using these macros requires for now:
(load-from-path "ice-9/expect")

@code{expect} is a macro for selecting actions based on the output from
a port.  The name comes from a tool of similar functionality by Don Libes.
Actions can be taken when a particular string is matched, when a timeout
occurs, or when end-of-file is seen on the port.  The @code{expect} macro
is described below; @code{expect-strings} is a front-end to @code{expect}
based on regexec (see the regular expression documentation).

@defmac expect-strings clause @dots{}
By default, @code{expect-strings} will read from the current input port.
The first term in each clause consists of an expression evaluating to
a string pattern (regular expression).  As characters
are read one-by-one from the port, they are accumulated in a buffer string
which is matched against each of the patterns.  When a
pattern matches, the remaining expression(s) in
the clause are evaluated and the value of the last is returned.  For example:

@smalllisp
(with-input-from-file "/etc/passwd"
  (lambda ()
    (expect-strings
      ("^nobody" (display "Got a nobody user.\n")
                 (display "That's no problem.\n"))
      ("^daemon" (display "Got a daemon user.\n")))))
@end smalllisp

The regular expression is compiled with the @code{REG_NEWLINE} flag, so
that the ^ and $ anchors will match at any newline, not just at the start
and end of the string.

There are two other ways to write a clause:

The expression(s) to evaluate
can be omitted, in which case the result of the regular expression match
(converted to strings, as obtained from regexec with match-pick set to "")
will be returned if the pattern matches.

The symbol @code{=>} can be used to indicate that the expression is a
procedure which will accept the result of a successful regular expression
match.  E.g.,

@smalllisp
("^daemon" => write)
("^d\\(aemon\\)" => (lambda args (for-each write args)))
("^da\\(em\\)on" => (lambda (all sub)
                         (write all) (newline)
                         (write sub) (newline)))
@end smalllisp

The order of the substrings corresponds to the order in which the
opening brackets occur.

A number of variables can be used to control the behaviour
of @code{expect} (and @code{expect-strings}).
By default they are all bound at the top level to
the value @code{#f}, which produces the default behaviour.
They can be redefined at the
top level or locally bound in a form enclosing the expect expression.

@table @code
@item expect-port
A port to read characters from, instead of the current input port.
@item expect-timeout
@code{expect} will terminate after this number of
seconds, returning @code{#f} or the value returned by expect-timeout-proc.
@item expect-timeout-proc
A procedure called if timeout occurs.  The procedure takes a single argument:
the accumulated string.
@item expect-eof-proc
A procedure called if end-of-file is detected on the input port.  The
procedure takes a single argument: the accumulated string.
@item expect-char-proc
A procedure to be called every time a character is read from the
port.  The procedure takes a single argument: the character which was read.
@end table

Here's an example using all of the variables:

@smalllisp
(let ((expect-port (open-input-file "/etc/passwd"))
      (expect-timeout 1)
      (expect-timeout-proc
        (lambda (s) (display "Times up!\n")))
      (expect-eof-proc
        (lambda (s) (display "Reached the end of the file!\n")))
      (expect-char-proc display))
   (expect-strings
     ("^nobody"  (display "Got a nobody user\n"))))
@end smalllisp
@end defmac

@defmac expect clause @dots{}
@code{expect} is used in the same way as @code{expect-strings},
but tests are specified not as patterns, but as procedures.  The
procedures are called in turn after each character is read from the
port, with the value of the accumulated string as the argument.  The
test is successful if the procedure returns a non-false value.

If the @code{=>} syntax is used, then if the test succeeds it must return
a list containing the arguments to be provided to the corresponding
expression.

In the following example, a string will only be matched at the beginning
of the file:

@smalllisp
(let ((expect-port (open-input-file "/etc/passwd")))
  (expect
     ((lambda (s) (string=? s "fnord!"))
        (display "Got a nobody user!\n"))))
@end smalllisp

The control variables described for @code{expect-strings} can also
be used with @code{expect}.

@node The Scheme shell (scsh)
@chapter The Scheme shell (scsh)

--- includes info on how to get SCSH features (open this
    module), but mostly just a pointer to the SCSH manual.
    This should not be under POSIX.  SCSH includes plenty of
    high-level stuff for starting processes and string
    processing.  SCSH is not a subset of POSIX, nor the
    reverse.

[FIXME: I'm pasting in Gary's stuff from unix.texi's SCSH chapter; it
should be almost entirely OK.]


Guile includes an incomplete port of the Scheme shell (scsh) 0.4.4.

For information about scsh on the Web see
@url{http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/scsh/scsh.html}.
The original scsh is available by ftp from
@url{ftp://swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/su}.

This port of scsh does not currently use the Guile module system, but
can be initialized using:
@smalllisp
(load-from-path "scsh/init")
@end smalllisp

Note that SLIB must be installed before scsh can be initialized, see
@ref{SLIB} for details.

[FIXME: I (Mark) think we should also put examples of using scsh in
Guile that highlight how it is different from SCSH; for example, the
SLIB requirement.]
