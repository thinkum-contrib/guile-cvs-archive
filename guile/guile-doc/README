This is the Guile documentation module, a work-in-progress.  It
includes information from many sources written at many different
stages of Guile's development, and is therefore in a state of some
confusion.

The `ref' directory contains the Guile reference manual, in progress.

The `tutorial' directory contains the Guile user tutorial, in progress.

The `sources' directory includes some stuff relevant to the Guile
reference manual, and which may eventually be folded in to it.  It's
not immediately relevant, however, which is why it's not in the ref
directory.

The `old' directory is documentation from the Guile 1.0 distribution.
This has been wildly overhauled and is generally out of date, but
we're keeping it around until the new Guile reference and tutorial
manual are reasonably stable.
