* r5rs.texi does not build to r5rs.dvi

The problem here is that r5rs.texi is autogenerated by a tool from the
original LaTeX for R5RS, and it's not clear that it's worth fixing the
errors in r5rs.texi (some of which are non-trivial) when people would
be better advised to start from the LaTeX anyway.
