everyone has their own style, so maybe this will be a lonely place.

libguile doc snarfing currently uses cpp and requires a C language tokenizer,
the latter implemented via flex.  it's probably ok to install the tokenizer in
$libexec and write scripts/read-c-source to DTRT.  read-c-source needs to be
extensible to support snarfing from comments (popular technique used in other
projects).

snarfing to produce guile-procedures.txt is another question.

the tokenizer might be useful to a C translator.
