setting up this directory to encourage published personal expression.
everyone has their own style, so maybe this will be a lonely place.

libguile doc snarfing currently uses cpp and requires a C language tokenizer,
the latter implemented via flex.  it's probably ok to install the tokenizer in
$libexec and write scripts/read-c-source to DTRT.  read-c-source needs to be
extensible to support snarfing from comments (popular technique used in other
projects).

snarfing to produce guile-procedures.txt is another question.

the tokenizer might be useful to a C translator.

do i want to work *with* others?  yes, but only given a framework that shows
me that others know how to work w/ others (so that i may learn).  simulated
annealing is certainly acceptable but then where does the fire come from?
lines of code folded into daggers of misunderstanding, happens every time.

in my mind i see the circus act w/ 3 motorcycles speeding around a 3m diameter
cage (on the inside!) and observe the changing patterns of their motion.  the
riders move gravity and inertia in between their thoughts.  fundamental forces
are traded for concentrated control of the universe.

society teaches kids to kill their keepers (who happen to be each other),
these days.  an old tree is allergic to its outermost ring, whose pores let
through the rest of the world but not unwaveringly.  as the pores close, the
tree loses touch w/ reality and steeps in its poisons.  it is a great sadness.

going to concentrate on 1.4.x, let experimentation continue elsewhere w/o
furthre comment -- back-port the good bits ignore the rest.

maybe THUD can live again.
