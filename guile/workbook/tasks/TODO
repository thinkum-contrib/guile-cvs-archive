- Guile 1.6.1 (branched: only modify items according to ../build/release.txt)


- Eventually
  - Allow the deprecation mechanism to be controlled via a preprocessor
    macro analogous to _GNU_SOURCE. [talk to mvo about this]
  - consider (and likely code) guile using pkg-config
  + also show bidi set-difference counts in api-diff [ttn]

  - use autoconf vars abs_top_* vars (but not w/ autoconf 2.53)
  - write render-bugs, add to mscripts or guile-tools [ttn]

  - write why-not-release? scanner
  - forward port guile-1.6.x stuff
    - guile-snarf and docs
    - determine rest of list
  - extend render-bugs to harvest (and run?) test cases
  - fix signal-handling + threading
    - remove GUILE_OLD_ASYNC_CLICK and friends
  - implement and integrate generational garbage collection
  - add POSIX thread support
  - factor thread support out of libguile
  - protect common resources using mutecis from the new interface
  - remove the dynamic roots
  - revise the fluid implementation
  - implement the GC thread synchronization (all threads: go to sleep!)
  - implementing the libguileposix threads glue library
  - write Orbit CORBA interface
  - use environments to implement low-level module obarray
  - specify role of shared object libraries in module system
  - move sort.c, random.c, etc out of libguile
  - include malloc debugging code in an optional file in libguile
  - fix looking up procedure names in environment in backtraces
  - implement srcprops using double cells
  - use "real" procprops
  - add facilities for easily debugging Scheme programs from Emacs
  - write good interface to Tk
  - write translators for additional languages
  - make GDB work with Guile
  - use the SCM trick of tagging environments with immediates (see m_letrec1)
    to convert source correctly in unmemocopy
  - eliminate argument checking for closures
  - Implement a thread-safe alternative to SCM's environment caches
  - develop better representation for GOOPS objects
  - rewrite GOOPS method cache management in C
  - rewrite GOOPS macros (define-class et al) in C
  - define GOOPS C API
  - make all syscalls block only the current thread, using scm_internal_select.
  - unify SRFI-4 and the existing uniform array code
  - rename ice-9 to something more obvious
  - implement implicitly shared substrings (thread-safe, copy on write).  In
    this context, the concept of read-only-strings might be re-introduced to
    implement the symbol->string semantics of R5RS.
  - implement internationalized strings
  - revise the uniform vector implementation
  - make the set of error signalling functions more consistent
  - Fix bug reported by Sven.Hartrumpf@fernuni-hagen.de 2001-08-31:
    (debug-disable 'debug) has no effect if it is the first form in ~/.guile.
  - provide a non-extended implementation of 'define' for the R5RS module.
  - write instructions on how to build Guile for distributors
  - publish (automated) build status matrix
  - write tests for each bug
  - test elisp translator against rfc822.el
  - provide doc snarfing
    - rationalize / integrate various scripts
    - document
    - re-enable install of constituent programs
  - make sure all *.scm have some commentary (including manual ref)
    - ice-9
    - oop
    + srfi [ttn]
    - lang
  - add DLL support [ela]
  - write emacs/patch.el
    + outgoing [ttn]
    - incoming [ttn]
  - Compile with --enable-error-on-warning without failure.  Requires a
    number of fixes, including num2integral.i.c and on some platforms
    gc_os_dep.c.  Also SCM_FIXABLE etc. will produce unavoidable
    warnings on some platforms with some vars as written now.  i.e. on
    alphas, SCM_FIXABLE(some_int) is always true.  We need more
    conditional compilation or similar.
  - remove deprecated function "feature?".
  - remove deprecated macros SCM_NEWCELL and SCM_NEWCELL2 together with
    their support staffing scm_deprecated_newcell,
    scm_deprecated_newcell2, scm_tc16_allocated, mark_allocated.
  - remove deprecated functions scm_must_malloc,
    scm_must_realloc, scm_must_free, scm_done_malloc, scm_done_free,
    scm_must_strndup, scm_must_strdup.
  - change return types of smob and port free functions to void
