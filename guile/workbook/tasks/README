In contrast to most of its sibling directories, this directory is
concerned with the enumeration and ownership of tasks, and the
conventional way of doing and communicating these things.


The TODO File

	Items are grouped by target release version.  The first group is
	"Eventually", which is not associated w/ any particular version.
	Items should be initially added to this group, and then later
	moved under a version upon either ownership or sponsorship.

	Maintainers (w/ write privs) indicate ownership by `[USERNAME]'.
	Use `[ACTUAL-OWNER:MAINTAINER]' to indicate sponsorship, where
	both elements are usernames.

	Upon completion, simply change the "-" to a "+", but do not
	delete the item.  At release time, the "+" entries will be
	deleted after review to make sure that user-visible changes are
	reflected in NEWS.

	During the time between ownership (sponsorship) and completion,
	a task is said to be work-in-progress.  If you wish to record
	some finer gradation of status, use one of these markers
	immediately following the "-":

	D -- design/discussion phase (i.e., "don't expect a checkin
	     or patch any time soon")

	X -- blocked on external dependency (for example, waiting for
	     paperwork, or profiling survey results)

	N% (N a number) -- N% "complete"

	R -- review requested (the task is done and you've asked for
	     some kind of (in)sanity check or review, for possible
	     redirection and followup)

	Feel free to define (and document above) additional markers.

	Note that even though lots of things related to specific task
	are under discussion (for a long time in some cases), in the
	interests of promoting a clean TODO protocol, you should avoid
	setting "D" until actual ownership or sponsorship.


How Bugs Fit In

	Some tasks are related to fixing bugs.  At this time there is no
	special convention for handling or indicating this in TODO.

	[Probably after some discussion this section can be written.]


Individual TODO Files

	Feel free to keep individual todo files either in this directory
	or under ../journal/ in any format under any discipline you want
	(or use the above conventions if you want to make use of scripts
	that grok the TODO file).

	Individual TODO files are useful if you want to break a task
	down into constituent subtasks, or (to go the other direction in
	scope) for long-running over-arching background tasks for which
	the main TODO file actually *IS* the breakdown (for example,
	"improve hacker coordination" or "make guile compiler-friendly
	again" or "practice my meager project manglement skills").
