+ 	These changes fixes a race condition in the Guile coop - pthread
+ 	compatibility code.
+
+ 	* coop.c (mother_awake_p): New variable.
+ 	(coop_create): Set mother_awake_p before creating or signalling
+ 	mother; wait until mother is going to sleep before returning.
+ 	(mother): Reset mother_awake_p before going to sleep.

ttn sez:
crash still occurs w/ "guile -s bug.scm" (cvs checkout on 2001/11/06).
however, "guile -l bug.scm" works as expected.
