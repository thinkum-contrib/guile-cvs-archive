summary: we need to properly instruct distributors how to package Guile
reported: Neil Jerram, 2002
tags: release-critical-1.8
affects: HEAD

Rob Browning will make Debian packages so he should know, and he says
he will talk to the Redhat guys to make a proper Guile package.

This is no longer release critical since an initial stab at the file
has been created, but this file needs further work, and an improved
file needs to be added to HEAD for 1.7.
