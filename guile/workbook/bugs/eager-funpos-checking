Subject: Widespread bug in handling (call/cc (lambda (c) (0 (c 1)))) => 1

The expression (call/cc (lambda (c) (0 (c 1)))) is a legal expression
according to r5rs, whose semantics are that 1 gets returned when it is
passed to the escape procedure c during the evaluation of the
positions of the combination (0 (c 1)).

A quick survey of the scheme implementations I have handy indicates
that this is a commonly missed compliance issue:

  Petite Chez 6.0a      Error: attempt to apply non-procedure
  SCM 5d6               ERROR: Wrong type to apply
  Bigloo 2.4b           *** ERROR:bigloo:eval: Not a procedure
  scsh 0.6.0            okay (gives a warning)
  MzScheme 200alpha12   okay

Implementors, please place this on your list of earth-shatteringly
important issues, just after getting (let - ((n (- 1))) n) => -1
right.
