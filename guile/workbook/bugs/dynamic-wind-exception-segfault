summary: interaction of dynamic-wind, call/cc, exceptions and/or handler causes segfault
reported: Gary Houston <ghouston@arglist.com>, 2002-04-08
affects: HEAD branch_release-1-4

This example is from workbook/extension/dynamic-root.txt.  It's
probably not surprising that nesting exception handlers and dynamic
wind may cause difficulties.

(define with-reentry-barrier
  (lambda (thunk)
    (let ((entered #f))
      (dynamic-wind
	  (lambda ()
	    (if entered
		(error "Attempt to break reentry barrier")
		(set! entered #t)))
	  thunk
	  (lambda () #f)))))

(define (break-me user-proc)
  (catch #t
	 (lambda ()
	   (display "executing user ...\n")
	   (with-reentry-barrier user-proc)
	   (display "... done\n"))
	 (lambda args
	   (display "outer catch!\n")
	   (write args))))

guile> (define cont #f)
(break-me (lambda ()
	    (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c)
					      (set! cont c)))))

guile> executing user ...
... done
guile> (cont #f)
Segmentation fault
