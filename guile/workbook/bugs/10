summary: embedded libltdl masks system version unconditionally

Bill Gribble sez:
> The guideline for when to use the convenience version of libltdl is

>
> > In general you can safely use the convenience library in
> > programs which don't depend on other libraries that might
> > use libltdl too.
>
> So guile's use of the convenience library embodies an assumption about
> programs which use guile: that they will not use libltdl except through
> guile's wrapper (dynamic-link and friends).
>
> It seems like this is a bad assumption for guile to make, since it is
> intended to be used as an extension language for many different kinds of
> programs and not to put a priori restrictions on what they can do.
> Especially when those restrictions are not documented.
>
> I would suggest that prior to the guile-1.6 release the use of the
> convenience ltdl library be removed, instead depending on an installed
> version of libltdl.
