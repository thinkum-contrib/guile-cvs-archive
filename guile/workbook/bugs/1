summary: (debug-disable 'debug) has no effect if first form in ~/.guile
reported: Sven.Hartrumpf@fernuni-hagen.de, 2001-08-31
affects: HEAD branch_release-1-6 branch_release-1-4
fixed: Neil Jerram, 2001-11-07, guile-core, HEAD

ttn sez:
buggy behavior confirmed on both 1.5.x and 1.7.x.

on the other hand, when second or later, the expected effect (disabling use of
debugging evaluator) seems to be reflected when viewing the debug options.  it
could be that the bug is in display and not the actual setting.

NJ 2002-03-08:

Problem was caused by (top-repl)'s loading of (ice-9 debug), which
ended with unconditional `(debug-enable 'debug)'.  Fixed by removing
the offending lines.

ttn 2002-03-25:

in the discussion two module usages were identified based on whether or not
side effects on load are to be expected.
