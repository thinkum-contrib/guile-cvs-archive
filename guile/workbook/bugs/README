This directory is the Guile bug data base.

It contains one file per bug with a simple, mail-message like format.
Each file starts with a number of header lines in the form

     field-name: field-value

where 'field-name' contains no whitespace and is compared
case-insensitive.  'field-value' can be continued in the next line by
using a '\' as the last character of the current line.  The header is
separated from the body by a blank line.  The body is the rest of the
file.  There is no limit on the length of a line.

The following header fields are defined.  They are optional except
when noted.

  Summary: <text>

    A one-line summary of the bug.  Mandatory

  Tags: tag1, tag2, ...  

    A comma separated list of symbolic tag names (for example
    release-critical-1.6).  Tags can be used to collect bugs into
    ad-hoc groups.

  Reported-By: mail address
    
    The mail address of the reporter, in RFC822 format.
  
  Reported-Date: yyyy-mm-dd [hh:mm:ss UTC]

    The date the bug was first reported, in ISO format.  Time is
    optional.

If you need more header fields, please document them here.

The names of the bug files can be chosen almost arbitrarily.  They
must start with a lower case letter and must not contain a "."
character.  If you don't want to use a symbolic name, use a name of
the form "bug-<n>" where <n> is the next unused number.  These names
are used to refer to bugs from within the description of other bugs,
and in discussions, so it helps to use mildly descriptive names.
Files that are related to a bug, like test programs that invoke the
bug, should get the name of the bug plus a "."-separated extension,
like "bug-1.scm".

Meta information about the bug tracking system (like this README file)
should be put into files that start with a upper case letter.
