summary: ash has problems with inexact numbers

Under scm_ash, the doc string:

	    "Formally, the function returns an integer equivalent to\n"
	    "@code{(inexact->exact (floor (* @var{n} (expt 2 @var{cnt}))))}.\n"

is incorrect:

guile> (ash .1 2)
0.4

but ash is not handling negative shifts correctly:

guile> (ash .1 -2)

Backtrace:
In standard input:
    4: 0* [ash 0.1 -2]

standard input:4:1: In procedure quotient in expression (ash 0.1 -2):
standard input:4:1: Wrong type argument in position 1: 0.1
ABORT: (wrong-type-arg)

The scm_quotient function assumes its arguments are ints/bignums,
so it can't be used directly in ash.
