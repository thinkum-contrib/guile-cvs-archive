summary: design decisions not recorded
reported: lord@regexps.com, 2001-08

changes are made w/ little documentation on their motivation, design and
consequences.  past initiatives and current maintainer discipline to support
them need shoring up.

ttn sez:
someone also mentioned that process and product are orthogonal; nastiness can
result in/from either, and for different reasons.  i tend to believe this up
until a certain point, when the process becomes self-aware and includes its own
improvement in its considerations.  then, hopefully it becomes light.

to change people is difficult, but that's why we have guile...
