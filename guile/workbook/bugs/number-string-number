R5RS requires that

       (eqv? number
             (string->number (number->string number
                                             radix)
                             radix)))

and puts additional requirements on flonums in base 10.

Guile doesn't conform to this.  It doesn't respect the radix for
non-integers, for example.

This is a difficult but solved problem (the flonums in base 10 are
difficult).  There are papers and there should be code out there.
