Part of the build process is recording the API and its groupings.
This should be done after changing Scheme or C interface, or
                    after changing doc/groupings.alist.

To do this:

  cd $(top_builddir)/doc
  make guile-api.alist

The new guile-api.alist is actually deposited in $(top_srcdir)/doc.
