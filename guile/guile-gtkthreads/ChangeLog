2000-04-08  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* gthread-guile.c (g_guile_thread_functions_for_glib): Filled in
	entries for create, yield, join and exit.
	(g_thread_self_guile_impl): Set the thread pointer to a pointer to
	the running thread.
	(g_thread_create_guile_impl, g_thread_join_guile_impl): New
	functions.

2000-04-06  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Test if thread_create is present in
	GThreadFunctions.

	* acconfig.h: New file.

	* gthread-guile.c (g_thread_set_priority_guile_impl,
	g_thread_self_guile_imple): New functions.
	(g_guile_thread_functions_for_glib): Added above two functions.
	(Thanks to Ole Myren Rohne.)

2000-03-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in (LIBS): Put GUILE_LDFLAGS first in case it is
	installed under /usr/local.

2000-03-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* threads.scm (gtkthreads-handler?, gtkthreads-ensure-handler):
	New procedures.

2000-03-30  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* GTKTHREADS-VERSION: Release of 0.1.2.
	
	* gtkthreads.c, threads.scm (gtkthreads-update): Disabled.  (Not
	needed.  The true reason why things didn't get updated was simply
	that the X queue wasn't flushed.  This can be done with
	`gdk-flush'.)

	* Makefile.am: Add gtkthreads.x to BUILT_SOURCES.

	* gtkthreads.c, gtkthreads.h (gtkthreads-update): New procedure:
	Wakes up the main loop so that it begins to handle pending
	events.  (Ideally this should be performed automatically.)
	(g_poll): Extended to support waking up.

	* GTKTHREADS-VERSION: Bumped to 0.1.1.

2000-03-29  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Check that Guile is recent enough.
	
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: handle GTKTHREADS-VERSION.

	* GTKTHREADS-VERSION: New file.

	* threads.scm: New file.

	* gthread-guile.c (g_mutex_new_guile_impl): Removed second arg to
	scm_mutex_init.  Layout.

	* Makefile.am: Renamed the library to libguilegtkthreads.

	* gtkthreads.c: Added #include <libguile/dynl.h>, #include
	"gtkthreads.h".
	(scm_init_gtk_guilegtkthreads_module): Renamed from
	scm_init_gtk_gtkthreads_module.
