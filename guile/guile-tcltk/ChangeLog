	* Makefile.in (exec_prefix, bindir, libdir, includedir, infodir):
	Get values directly from autoconf, instead of deriving them
	ourselves.

	* Makefile.in (glsdir): Not used; removed.
	(pkgincludedir): New variable.
	(install): Create the $(prefix) directory.  Don't create
	$(glsdir).  Create and install the header files in
	$(pkgincludedir), instead of $(includedir).
	(uninstall): Remove the header files from the appropriate
	directory.
	* configure.in: Get the current Guile version, and substitute it
	into Makefile, so we can compute pkgincludedir.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Thu Aug 15 19:04:34 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -ldl; if present, add it to the list of
 	libraries Guile should link against.
	* PLUGIN/guile.config.in (xtra_libs): Here's where it goes, if
	it's present.

Thu Aug 15 17:25:36 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Rework the strategy for selectively omitting this subdir from the
 	build.  The old idea was to not configure it at all, but then
	disties don't work.  See the top-level ChangeLog.
	* PLUGIN/guile.inits, PLUGIN/guile.libs: Replace
 	PLUGIN/guile.inits.in and PLUGIN/guile.libs.in; they're constant,
 	and distributed as-is.  Not creating them was a kludge.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Don't create PLUGIN/guile.inits or
	PLUGIN/guile.libs.
	* Makefile.in (dist): Distribute PLUGIN/guile.inits and
 	PLUGIN/guile.libs.

Thu Aug 15 03:29:58 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	This subtree shouldn't participate in the build process at all if
 	the top-level makefile elected not to configure it.
	* PLUGIN/guile.config, PLUGIN/guile.inits, PLUGIN/guile.libs: All
 	renamed to mumble.in.
	* configure.in: Construct the PLUGIN/mumble files from the
	PLUGIN/mumble.in files.  This way, if we're never configured, the
	mumble files will not appear, and other subdirs won't get
	confused.
	* GUILE.vars.in: Remove this; integrate its guts into...
	* PLUGIN/guile.config.in: here.
	* Makefile.in (ancillary, dist-dir): Distribution code adjusted
	appropriately.

Thu Aug 15 01:31:49 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Added the gtcltk-lib tree to Guile. 

Thu Mar 21 19:58:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (X_CFLAGS): New variable, whose value is provided by
	the configure script.
	(ALL_CFLAGS): Include the value of X_CFLAGS, so the pre-processor
	can find the X Window System #include files.

Fri Mar  1 12:47:41 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* guile-tcl.c (scm_tcl_apply_command): handle arguments
	which are procedures correctly.

Thu Feb 29 18:35:48 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* guile-tcl.c (scm_tcl_global_eval):  defer/allow ints
	(invoke_tcl_command): mark ints during callout
	(scm_tcl_delete_command): defer/allow ints
	(scm_tcl_get_int): not leaking result any more
	(scm_tcl_get_double): not leaking result any more
	(scm_tcl_get_boolean): not leaking result any more
	(scm_tcl_split_list): not leaking result any more, defer/allow
	ints better
	(scm_tcl_merge): defer/allow ints better
	(scm_tcl_trace_var2): not leaking result any more, defer/allow
	ints better 
	(scm_tcl_apply_command): handle ints/memory less spastically
	(trace_variable): mask ints during trace


***	(scm_tcl_untrace_var2): This looks bogus.



Tue Jan 30 15:12:31 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): standards.info

Fri Jan 26 13:53:10 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* (in gtk): fixed bug reported by Aleksandar Bakic <bakicale@cps.msu.edu>.
	Anonymous procedures as menu-item commands didn't work, now they do.

Wed Aug 16 13:19:31 1995  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* Makefile.in (install): Install the header files.
	(reported by webbb@lx3.tucson.saic.com (Brian Webb))

	* Gtcl.scm ((reify-tcl-command interp name)): allowed
	widget names to be unquoted when passed to a Tcl command.
	(reported by hjstein@MATH.HUJI.AC.IL)

Sat Jul  1 23:20:25 1995  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>
