1998-06-28  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* tcltk.scm (tcl-type-converters): Added `string' to set of type
	converters.

Thu Jun 25 06:07:32 1998  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@totoro.red-bean.com>

        subdirectory and set variable appropriately if found.
        (CPPFLAGS): Add TCLTK_INCLUDE, TK_INCLUDE here.
        (CFLAGS): Remove them from here.

1998-04-21  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	Thread system adaptions.

	* tclInt.h, tclUnixNotfy.c, tclUnixPort.h, license.terms: New

	scm_internal_select and makes some functions accessible to make
	smooth interaction with Guile threads possible.

	Call scm_puts and scm_putc, not scm_gen_puts and scm_gen_putc.

	* configure.in: Don't check for -lqt and -lguile in the usual way.
  	Run "build-guile link" to make sure Guile's installed, and tack
 	its output onto the end of LIBS.  (For some vague reason, I'd
 	rather call build-guile at make time, rather than configure time,
 	but this seems to work okay...)
	* configure: Regenerated.
	
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4: Regenerated with automake-1.2c.
	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.guess, config.sub: Updated to

	can be optionally used on systems where Tcl and Tk reside in
	different directories.  (This is a common situation.)
	INSTALL: Updated to reflect the above change.
	Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Updated.

Tue May 13 17:08:29 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Make the Guile/Tcl/Tk glue library a separate module.
	* Makefile.am: (EXTRA_LTLIBRARIES): Deleted; nothing is optional
	any more.
	(lib_LTLIBRARIES): Move libgtcltk.la to here, since it's always
	built.
	(bin_PROGRAMS): New program: guile-tcltk.
	(guile_tcltk_LDADD): List the libraries we have to link it against.
	(INCLUDES): Deleted.  We use the installed headers now.
	(SNARF): Deleted.  We use the installed snarfer now.
	* configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Call this, instead of ...
	(AC_INIT_GUILE_MODULE): ... this.
	(AM_MAINTAINER_MODE): Deleted; not needed.
	(AC_ARG_WITH): Fix option name from "tcl" to "tk".
 	(AC_PATH_X): Removed; AC_PATH_XTRA is a superset of it.  Put the
	cflags and libs we find directly in CFLAGS and LIBS.
	Nothing is optional any more; require that Tcl, Tk, and Guile be
	installed.  Don't look for SNARF; just use the installed snarfer.
	Don't create plugin files.
	(AC_FUNC_ALLOCA): Don't check for this.
	* guile-tcl.c, guile-tcl.h, guile-tk.c, guile-tk.h: Just #include
	<libguile.h>, don't try to grab a bunch of internal stuff.
	* guile-tcltk.c: New file, built into the installed executable.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Degeneraret.

Fri Apr 11 20:09:14 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Don't run the snarfer if Tcl/Tk support isn't enabled.
	* Makefile.am: Let the configure script specify the name of the
	snarfer, via the @SNARF@ substitution.
	* configure.in: Set @SNARF@ to the real snarfer name iff Tcl/Tk
	support is actually enabled; otherwise, set it to ":", so the
	snarfing commands don't do anything.
	* Makefile.in, configure: Rebuilt.

Thu Apr 10 15:07:23 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am (MKDEP): Use -MM, not -M, so we don't get
	dependencies for system header files.  We still get deps for the
	stuff within the Guile dist, though.
	* Makefile.in: Rebuilt.

Wed Apr  9 17:57:44 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.am: Made libgtcltk into a libtool library.
	* PLUGIN/Makefile.am (guile.config): Removed "-L ../gtcltk-lib"

	* .cvsignore: ignore "*.lo", the libtool library objects.

Wed Jan  8 08:31:40 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

Tue Jan  7 18:58:34 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Make sure we search /usr/local/lib and
 	/usr/local/include, if they exist.  This helps us find Tcl on some
	systems.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Tue Dec 31 20:27:14 1996  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@kenneth>

	* guile-tcl.c (scm_tcl_create_interp, scm_tcl_merge): SCM_CXR -->

	* configure.in: Use $DL_LIBS, not -ldl, in tcl7.5 check.

Fri Dec  6 20:41:05 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* configure.in: added -ldl in the tcl7.5 check, although you would
	think it would have been there because of the previous -ldl
	check, but it was not working.

Sat Nov 30 23:49:43 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* PLUGIN/Makefile.am: New file.
	* PLUGIN/greet, guile.inits, guile.libs: Removed.

 	"smob.h"

Thu Oct 10 14:30:41 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* guile-tcl.c (print_interp): Fix type of third argument to smob

	Find the libguile headers correctly when building in a separate
	dir.
	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Refer to GTCLTK_INCLUDES and
	LIBGUILE_INCLUDES; the net effect is to add -I$(srcdir) and
	-I.. to the header path.
	(GTCLTK_INCLUDES, LIBGUILE_INCLUDES): New variables.

Tue Sep 10 16:51:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* guile-tcl.c, guile-tk.c: Use the SCM_P macro to declare
	prototypes, instead of the PROTO macro, which libguile.h doesn't
	#define any more.

Wed Sep  4 00:47:01 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Don't search $(srcdir)/../gtcl or
	$(srcdir)/../gtk; they don't exist any more.

	guile-tcl.h and guile-tk.h directly in $(includedir).

	accomodate the new libguile header file arrangement.

	* PLUGIN/guile.config.in (xtra_cflags): Remove references to gtcl
	and gtk directories; they're long gone.

	* Makefile.in (exec_prefix, bindir, libdir, includedir, infodir):
	Get values directly from autoconf, instead of deriving them
	ourselves.

	* Makefile.in (glsdir): Not used; removed.
	(pkgincludedir): New variable.
	(install): Create the $(prefix) directory.  Don't create
	$(glsdir).  Create and install the header files in
	$(pkgincludedir), instead of $(includedir).
	(uninstall): Remove the header files from the appropriate
	directory.
	* configure.in: Get the current Guile version, and substitute it
	into Makefile, so we can compute pkgincludedir.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Thu Aug 15 19:04:34 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -ldl; if present, add it to the list of
 	libraries Guile should link against.
	* PLUGIN/guile.config.in (xtra_libs): Here's where it goes, if
	it's present.

Thu Aug 15 17:25:36 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Rework the strategy for selectively omitting this subdir from the
 	build.  The old idea was to not configure it at all, but then
	disties don't work.  See the top-level ChangeLog.
	* PLUGIN/guile.inits, PLUGIN/guile.libs: Replace
 	PLUGIN/guile.inits.in and PLUGIN/guile.libs.in; they're constant,
 	and distributed as-is.  Not creating them was a kludge.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Don't create PLUGIN/guile.inits or
	PLUGIN/guile.libs.
	* Makefile.in (dist): Distribute PLUGIN/guile.inits and
 	PLUGIN/guile.libs.

Thu Aug 15 03:29:58 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	This subtree shouldn't participate in the build process at all if
 	the top-level makefile elected not to configure it.
	* PLUGIN/guile.config, PLUGIN/guile.inits, PLUGIN/guile.libs: All
 	renamed to mumble.in.
	* configure.in: Construct the PLUGIN/mumble files from the
	PLUGIN/mumble.in files.  This way, if we're never configured, the
	mumble files will not appear, and other subdirs won't get
	confused.
	* GUILE.vars.in: Remove this; integrate its guts into...
	* PLUGIN/guile.config.in: here.
	* Makefile.in (ancillary, dist-dir): Distribution code adjusted
	appropriately.

Thu Aug 15 01:31:49 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Added the gtcltk-lib tree to Guile. 

Thu Mar 21 19:58:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (X_CFLAGS): New variable, whose value is provided by
	the configure script.
	(ALL_CFLAGS): Include the value of X_CFLAGS, so the pre-processor
	can find the X Window System #include files.

Fri Mar  1 12:47:41 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	(scm_tcl_get_double): not leaking result any more
	(scm_tcl_get_boolean): not leaking result any more
	(scm_tcl_split_list): not leaking result any more, defer/allow
	ints better
	(scm_tcl_merge): defer/allow ints better
	(scm_tcl_trace_var2): not leaking result any more, defer/allow
	ints better 
	(scm_tcl_apply_command): handle ints/memory less spastically
	(trace_variable): mask ints during trace

	* guile-tcl.c (scm_tcl_untrace_var2): This looks bogus.

Tue Jan 30 15:12:31 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): standards.info

Fri Jan 26 13:53:10 1996  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* (in gtk): fixed bug reported by Aleksandar Bakic <bakicale@cps.msu.edu>.
	Anonymous procedures as menu-item commands didn't work, now they do.

Wed Aug 16 13:19:31 1995  Tom Lord  <lord@beehive>

	* Makefile.in (install): Install the header files.
	(reported by webbb@lx3.tucson.saic.com (Brian Webb))

	* PTTTTHHROK
