/* We represent an interpreter using SCM's "smob" representation.  The
   interpreter value points to a pair whose car is
   scm_tc16_tcl_interp, and whose cdr is a pointer to a struct
   gtcltk_interp, defined below.

   The following paragraph isn't true yet:

   We use Tcl_GetAssocData and Tcl_SetAssocData to map interpreter
   pointers onto their schemey representations, for use when we only
   have a Tcl interpreter pointer, and need to find the correponding
   scheme object.  */
