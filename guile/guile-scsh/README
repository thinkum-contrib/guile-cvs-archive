This is an incomplete port of the Scheme Shell, scsh 0.5.3, to Guile.
This is not a release of guile-scsh, but was presumably obtained at
some random time from the CVS archive.

For the original scsh package and documentation, see:

http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scsh/

This version of guile-scsh requires:

1) guile-core.  For best results, check it out of CVS at the same time
as guile-scsh.  Version 1.4 is too old.

2) The guilerxspencer module, available from http://arglist.com/guile/
A few guile-scsh modules can still be used if it's not installed.
It's possible to install guile-scsh first and guilerxspencer later.

Please send bug reports to:

bug-guile@gnu.org

To install the package, use something like:

./configure --prefix=<see below>
make install

The prefix given to configure should probably match the prefix where
Guile's site directory can be found.  Otherwise Guile won't find the
module without further configuration.  E.g.,

--prefix=/usr --> /usr/share/guile/site
--prefix=/usr/local --> /usr/local/share/guile/site

Alternatively it's sufficient to rename (or link) the main guile-scsh
directory to "scsh" and place it somewhere in the Guile load path (type
%load-path in an interactive Guile session to see the current
setting).

See the USAGE file for notes on using the library and INSTALL for 
generic configure documentation.
