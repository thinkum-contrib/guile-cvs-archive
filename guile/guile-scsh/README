This is an incomplete port of the Scheme Shell, scsh 0.5.3, to Guile.
This is not a release of guile-scsh, but was presumably obtained at
some random time from the CVS archive.

For the original scsh package and documentation, see:

http://www.scsh.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scsh/

This version of guile-scsh requires:

guile-core.  The 1.6 series is recommended.  CVS guile-scsh is not compatible
with the 1.4 series of guile-core.  CVS guile-core should work, although
with possible deprecation warnings.

The guilerxspencer module, available from http://arglist.com/guile/
A few guile-scsh modules can still be used if it's not installed.
It's possible to install guile-scsh first and guilerxspencer later.

Please send bug reports to:

bug-guile@gnu.org

To install the package, use something like:

./configure --prefix=<see below>
make install

The prefix given to configure should probably match the prefix where
Guile's site directory can be found.  Otherwise Guile won't find the
module without further configuration.  E.g.,

--prefix=/usr --> /usr/share/guile/site
--prefix=/usr/local --> /usr/local/share/guile/site

Alternatively it's sufficient to rename (or link) the main guile-scsh
directory to "scsh" and place it somewhere in the Guile load path (type
%load-path in an interactive Guile session to see the current
setting).

For more information see:

INSTALL for generic configure documentation.

USAGE for notes on using the library.

INCOMPAT for differences with the original scsh.
