This is an incomplete port of the scheme shell, scsh 0.5.2, to Guile.
This is not a release of guile-scsh, but was presumably obtained at
some random time from the CVS archive.

For the original scsh package and documentation, see:

http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh/

This version of guile-scsh requires:

1) guile-core dated 07 January 2001 or later for best results.  Version 1.4
is too old.

2) The guilerxspencer module, available from http://arglist.com/guile/

Please send bug reports to:

bug-guile@gnu.org

To install the package, use something like:

./configure
make install

The configure script will attempt to install guile-scsh in the Guile
site directory, as reported by guile-config in the current PATH.
Supplying a prefix argument to configure doesn't have any effect.

Alternatively it's sufficient to rename (or link) the main guile-scsh
directory to "scsh" and place it somewhere in the guile load path (type
%load-path in an interactive Guile session to see the current
setting).

See the USAGE file for notes on using the library.
