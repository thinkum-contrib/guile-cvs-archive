This is an incomplete port of the scheme shell (scsh) 0.5.1 to Guile.

The original scsh is available by ftp from
swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/su, which is also the place to go for scsh
documentation.

The Guile port uses a record type to represent the multiple values
returned by many scsh procedures.  The values can be retrieved
using call-with-values or receive.

The Guile module system is not currently being used.  Initialization
can be done by:

(load-from-path "scsh/init")

Note that SLIB must be found in %load-path, e.g., it can be unpacked
in the "site" directory.  SLIB can be obtained by ftp from
prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu/jacal directory.

The Guile reference manual also has information about installing
and using SLIB and scsh.


Hacking It Yourself ==================================================

As distributed, the Guile SCSH port needs only a Unix system to build
and install.  However, its makefiles, configuration scripts, and a few
other files are automatically generated, not written by hand.  If you
want to make changes to the system (which we encourage!) you will find
it helpful to have the tools we use to develop it.  They are the
following:

Autoconf 2.12 --- a system for automatically generating `configure'
	scripts from templates which list the non-portable features a
	program would like to use.  Available in
	"ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu".

Automake 1.1p --- a system for automatically generating Makefiles that
	conform to the (rather Byzantine) GNU coding standards.  The
	nice thing is that it takes care of hairy targets like 'make
	dist' and 'make distclean', and automatically generates
	Makefile dependencies.  Available in
	"ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey".

libtool 0.9d --- a system for managing the zillion hairy options needed
	on various systems to produce shared libraries.  Available in
	"ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu".

You are lost in a little maze of automatically generated files, all
different.
