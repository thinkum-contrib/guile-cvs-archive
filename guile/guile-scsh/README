This is an incomplete port of the scheme shell, scsh 0.5.2 to Guile.

For the original scsh package and documentation, see:

http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh/

Prerequisites for guile-scsh:

1) guile-core, version 1.4.  The CVS version of guile-scsh should also
work with the CVS version of guile-core: please report it as a bug if
it doesn't.

2) The guilerxspencer module, available from http://arglist.com/guile/
(FIXME: use modules, so that guilerxspencer is only needed if using
the scsh regex stuff).

Please send bug reports to:

bug-guile@gnu.org

To install the package, use something like:

configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install

See the INSTALL file for more details.

For now, the configure prefix must match the one where Guile is installed.
(FIXME: use guile-config to find the installation directory).

Alternatively it's sufficient to rename (or link) the main guile-scsh
directory to "scsh" and place it somewhere in the guile load path (type
%load-path in an interactive Guile session to see the current
setting).

The Guile module system is not currently used.  The package can be
loaded into a running Guile interpreter with:

(load-from-path "scsh/init")

The Guile port uses a record type to represent the multiple values
returned by many scsh procedures.  The values can be retrieved
using call-with-values or receive.  FIXME: check modern multiple values
usage in guile-core.

FIXME: delete the autogenerated files from the repository and remove
the text below.

Hacking It Yourself ==================================================

As distributed, the Guile SCSH port needs only a Unix system to build
and install.  However, its makefiles, configuration scripts, and a few
other files are automatically generated, not written by hand.  If you
want to make changes to the system (which we encourage!) you will find
it helpful to have the tools we use to develop it.  They are the
following:

Autoconf 2.12 --- a system for automatically generating `configure'
	scripts from templates which list the non-portable features a
	program would like to use.  Available in
	"ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu".

Automake 1.1p --- a system for automatically generating Makefiles that
	conform to the (rather Byzantine) GNU coding standards.  The
	nice thing is that it takes care of hairy targets like 'make
	dist' and 'make distclean', and automatically generates
	Makefile dependencies.  Available in
	"ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey".

libtool 0.9d --- a system for managing the zillion hairy options needed
	on various systems to produce shared libraries.  Available in
	"ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu".

You are lost in a little maze of automatically generated files, all
different.
