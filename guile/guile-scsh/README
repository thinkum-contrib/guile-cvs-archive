This is an incomplete port of the scheme shell, scsh 0.5.2, to Guile.
This is not a release of guile-scsh, but was presumably obtained at
some random time from the CVS archive.

For the original scsh package and documentation, see:

http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh/

This version of guile-scsh requires:

1) guile-core dated 27 November 2000 or later.  Version 1.4 is too old.

2) The guilerxspencer module, available from http://arglist.com/guile/

Please send bug reports to:

bug-guile@gnu.org

To install the package, use something like:

configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install

For now, the configure prefix must match the one where Guile is installed.
(FIXME: use guile-config to find the installation directory).

See the INSTALL file for more details.

Alternatively it's sufficient to rename (or link) the main guile-scsh
directory to "scsh" and place it somewhere in the guile load path (type
%load-path in an interactive Guile session to see the current
setting).

See the USAGE file for notes on using the library.

FIXME: delete the autogenerated files from the repository and remove
the text below.

Hacking It Yourself ==================================================

As distributed, the Guile SCSH port needs only a Unix system to build
and install.  However, its makefiles, configuration scripts, and a few
other files are automatically generated, not written by hand.  If you
want to make changes to the system (which we encourage!) you will find
it helpful to have the tools we use to develop it.  They are the
following:

Autoconf 2.12 --- a system for automatically generating `configure'
	scripts from templates which list the non-portable features a
	program would like to use.  Available in
	"ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu".

Automake 1.1p --- a system for automatically generating Makefiles that
	conform to the (rather Byzantine) GNU coding standards.  The
	nice thing is that it takes care of hairy targets like 'make
	dist' and 'make distclean', and automatically generates
	Makefile dependencies.  Available in
	"ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey".

libtool 0.9d --- a system for managing the zillion hairy options needed
	on various systems to produce shared libraries.  Available in
	"ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu".

You are lost in a little maze of automatically generated files, all
different.
