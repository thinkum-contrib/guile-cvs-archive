Incompatibilities with scsh 0.4.4:

many things are still missing.

everything is defined at the top level, no modules.

generic-receive-message! always returns 2 values: the number of
bytes read and the address received from.  Likewise for receive-message!
and receive-message (bug in scsh?)

network-info works when its argument is a socket address (bug in scsh?)

%read-delimited! takes a string for its "set of delimiters" parameter.
If the buffer fills, it doesn't peek ahead to check whether the next
character is a delimiter or EOF, since this a) seems to require extra
code or comparisons, b) makes read-delimted! and read-line! more complex
c) doesn't gain much anyway.

set-enabled-interrupts and with-interrupts have not been 
implemented.  Within a with-enabled-interrupts form, all interrupts are
disabled.
