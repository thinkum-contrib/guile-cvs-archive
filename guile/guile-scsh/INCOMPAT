Incompatibilities with the original scsh:
========================================

the Guile module system is not compatible with the one in Scheme48.

interrupt-set, set-enabled-interrupts, with-interrupts,
with-enabled-interrupts*, %set-unix-signal-handler and
%unix-signal-handler have not been implemented.  Within a
with-enabled-interrupts form, all interrupts are disabled.

[check that the following are still true in 0.5.2]

the interfaces to the I/O system may be incompatible.

generic-receive-message! always returns 2 values: the number of
bytes read and the address received from.  Likewise for receive-message!
and receive-message (bug in scsh?)

network-info works when its argument is a socket address (bug in scsh?)

%read-delimited! takes a string for its "set of delimiters" parameter.
If the buffer fills, it doesn't peek ahead to check whether the next
character is a delimiter or EOF, since this a) seems to require extra
code or comparisons, b) makes read-delimted! and read-line! more complex
c) doesn't gain much anyway.

set-command-line-args! is not implemented.
command-line returns the same list every time, not a copy.

itimer is not implemented.

The close-on-exec flag is not currently set on unrevealed ports.

the NDBM interface hasn't been implemented.

the flock interface hasn't been implemented.

net-to-host-32 etc., haven't been defined.

the files jcontrol.scm and jcontrol2.scm haven't been ported.

pty and tty support hasn't been implemented (pty.scm, tty.scm).

select! hasn't been implemented.

display and write don't accept file descriptors in place of ports.
