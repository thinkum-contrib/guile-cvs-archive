Incompatibilities with scsh 0.4.4:

many things are still missing.

everything is defined at the top level, no modules.

generic-receive-message! always returns 2 values: the number of
bytes read and the address received from.  Likewise for receive-message!
and receive-message (bug in scsh?)

network-info works when its argument is a socket address (bug in scsh?)

%read-delimited! takes a string for its "set of delimiters" parameter.
If the buffer fills, it doesn't peek ahead to check whether the next
character is a delimiter or EOF, since this a) seems to require extra
code or comparisons, b) makes read-delimted! and read-line! more complex
c) doesn't gain much anyway.

set-enabled-interrupts and with-interrupts have not been 
implemented.  Within a with-enabled-interrupts form, all interrupts are
disabled.

set-command-line-args! is not implemented.
command-line returns the same list every time, not a copy.

itimer is not implemented.

Several scsh procedures are incompatible with Guile procedures.
In these cases the procedures are redefined when init.scm is
loaded.  This isn't a very good solution: hopefully use of the
module system will help.  The following procedures are
affected: read-delimited read-delimited! pipe sleep exit make-fluid
and probably open-file.

The close-on-exec flag is not currently set on unrevealed ports.
