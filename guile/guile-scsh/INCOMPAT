Incompatibilities with scsh 0.4.4:

a lot of stuff is missing.

:optional renamed to optional.

everything is defined at the top level, no modules.

generic-receive-message! always returns 2 values: the number of
bytes read and the address received from.  Likewise for receive-message!
and receive-message (bug in scsh?)

network-info works when its argument is a socket address (bug in scsh?)
