extended process forms don't work:

(run (echo hello) (> out.log)))

Incompatibilities with the original scsh:
========================================

everything is defined at the top level, no modules.

loading guile-scsh may redefine Guile builtins.  e.g., map is
redefined by list-lib.scm.  This isn't very good.  Maybe use of the
module system will make this more manageable in future.  Other
affected procedures are: read-delimited read-delimited! pipe sleep
exit make-fluid string->list and probably open-file.

the interfaces to the I/O system may be incompatible.

[check that the following are still true in 0.5.2]

generic-receive-message! always returns 2 values: the number of
bytes read and the address received from.  Likewise for receive-message!
and receive-message (bug in scsh?)

network-info works when its argument is a socket address (bug in scsh?)

%read-delimited! takes a string for its "set of delimiters" parameter.
If the buffer fills, it doesn't peek ahead to check whether the next
character is a delimiter or EOF, since this a) seems to require extra
code or comparisons, b) makes read-delimted! and read-line! more complex
c) doesn't gain much anyway.

set-enabled-interrupts and with-interrupts have not been 
implemented.  Within a with-enabled-interrupts form, all interrupts are
disabled.

set-command-line-args! is not implemented.
command-line returns the same list every time, not a copy.

itimer is not implemented.

The close-on-exec flag is not currently set on unrevealed ports.

the NDBM interface hasn't been implemented.

the flock interface hasn't been implemented.

net-to-host-32 etc., haven't been defined.

the files jcontrol.scm and jcontrol2.scm haven't been ported.

pty and tty support hasn't been implemented (pty.scm, tty.scm).

select! hasn't been implemented.

display and write don't accept file descriptors in place of ports.
