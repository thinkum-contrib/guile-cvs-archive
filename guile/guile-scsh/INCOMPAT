Bugs
====

The use of Guile modules for individual components of scsh can cause
problems with macros that refer to unexported or imported bindings.
e.g., see the "run" comment in the USAGE file.

scsh features not implemented
=============================

enabled-interrupts, interrupt-set, itimer, %set-unix-signal-handler,
set-enabled-interrupts, %unix-signal-handler,
with-enabled-interrupts*.

Bugs in scsh fixed in guile-scsh
================================

delete-filesys-object can't delete directories in linux 2.4.

receive-message! usually returns only the number of bytes instead of
the two values documented in the scsh-manual: the number of bytes and
the remote address.  It does return the two values when EOF is seen.

receive-message usually fails since it tries to receive multiple
values from "receive-message!"  See above.

filter-weak-ptr-list in procobj.scm seems to have a typo in its last
line: list instead of lis.  This was causing problems for guile-scsh but
doesn't seem to matter in scsh.  Hmm.

Other Incompatibilities with scsh
=================================

The Guile module system is not compatible with the one in scsh (from
Scheme48).

Sockets are created unbuffered in Guile, but buffered in scsh.

with-enabled-interrupts disables all interrupts.

[check that the following are still true in 0.5.2]

the interfaces to the I/O system may be incompatible.

network-info works when its argument is a socket address (bug in scsh?)

%read-delimited! takes a string for its "set of delimiters" parameter.
If the buffer fills, it doesn't peek ahead to check whether the next
character is a delimiter or EOF, since this a) seems to require extra
code or comparisons, b) makes read-delimted! and read-line! more complex
c) doesn't gain much anyway.

set-command-line-args! is not implemented.
command-line returns the same list every time, not a copy.

The close-on-exec flag is not currently set on unrevealed ports.

the NDBM interface hasn't been implemented.

the flock interface hasn't been implemented.

net-to-host-32 etc., haven't been defined.

the files jcontrol.scm and jcontrol2.scm haven't been ported.

pty and tty support hasn't been implemented (pty.scm, tty.scm).

select! hasn't been implemented.

display and write don't accept file descriptors in place of ports.
