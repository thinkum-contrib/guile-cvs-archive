Changes in guile-scsh 2.0.0, compared to earlier versions (such as the
version distributed with Debian GNU/Linux circa 1998):

* Based on a more recent version of scsh.

* Use of the Guile module system.  While this is not exactly flawless,
it allows using parts of guile-scsh without loading the whole thing.

* Various additional features are supported, including Scheme-style
regular expressions.

* Some features of scsh are now implemented by the SRFI modules
supplied with guile-core.

* guile-scsh no longer depends on SLIB, but it now depends on
guilerxspencer.
