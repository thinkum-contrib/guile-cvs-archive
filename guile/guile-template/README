About This Distribution ==============================================

Building and installing this distribution gives you:

Interesting files include:
- INSTALL, which contains instructions on building and installing Guile.
- NEWS, which describes user-visible changes since the last release of Guile.
- COPYING, which describes the terms under which you may redistribute
  Guile, and explains that there is no warranty.

The PACKAGE source tree is laid out as follows:


Anonymous CVS Access and FTP snapshots ===============================

We make the developers' working PACKAGE sources available via
anonymous CVS, and by nightly snapshots, accessible via FTP.  See the
files `ANON-CVS' and `SNAPSHOTS' for details.

If you would like to receive mail when people commit changes to the
Guile CVS repository, you can subscribe to
guile-cvs@sourceware.cygnus.com by sending a message to
guile-cvs-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com.  Even better, you can get
daily digests of these commit messages by sending a message to
guile-cvs-digest-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com.

If you want to subscribe an e-mail address other than the one that
appears in your From: header, say foo@bar.com, send a mail note to
guile-cvs-subscribe-foo=bar.com@sourceware.cygnus.com.


Hacking It Yourself ==================================================

As distributed, PACKAGE needs only an ANSI C compiler and a Unix system
to compile.  However, PACKAGE's makefiles, configuration scripts, and a
few other files are automatically generated, not written by hand.  If
you want to make changes to the system (which we encourage!) you will
find it helpful to have the tools we use to develop PACKAGE.  They
are the following:

Autoconf 2.13 --- a system for automatically generating `configure'
	scripts from templates which list the non-portable features a
	program would like to use.  Available in
	"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf"

Automake 1.4 --- a system for automatically generating Makefiles that
	conform to the (rather Byzantine) GNU coding standards.  The
	nice thing is that it takes care of hairy targets like 'make
	dist' and 'make distclean', and automatically generates
	Makefile dependencies.  Automake is available in
	"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake"

libtool 1.3.3 --- a system for managing the zillion hairy options needed
	on various systems to produce shared libraries.  Available in
	"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libtool"
