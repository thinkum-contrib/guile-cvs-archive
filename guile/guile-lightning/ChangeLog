2001-04-09  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* lightning.c (nlistify, scm_invoke): Do not use va_lists to get
	at the arguments.
	(nlistify2): Removed.
	(scm_disassemble): Disassemble corresponding codevector when
	passed a code closure.

	* Makefile.am: Install assembler.scm and compiler.scm.

	* lightning.scm, assembler.scm: Renamed "lightning.scm" to
	"assembler.scm".  Renamed module to (lightning assembler).
	
	* compiler.scm: New file.

	* test.scm: Exercise the compiler some.

2001-04-06  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* rod.scm: Handle "jmp" and "call" right with respect to registers
	and immediates.

	* lightning.ops (jit_callr): Added.

	* lightning.c: Lotsa intricate stuff for efficiently invoking
	arbitrary procedure objects from compiled code.

	* test.scm: Readded old Fibonacci code, using more features, like
	a slight integration with the module system.

2001-04-01  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* test.scm: Started new generation of tests, using the new calling
	convention.
	* test-old.scm: Renamed from test.scm.
	
	* lightning.c (code, codevector): Changed old `code' smob to the
	name `codevector', which represents a closure template.  New smob
	`code', which represents a closure (template + environment).
	(call_tc, create_call_tc): Support for calling into the new
	tail-callable calling convention.
	(code_apply): Use it.
	(scm_make_closure): New, exported to Scheme.
	* lightning.scm (make-closure): Export.
	
2001-03-25  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* lightning.scm (asm-macros, register-asm-macro, get-asm-macro,
	asm-macroexpand, define-asm-macro): New, export
	(register-asm-macro and define-asm-macro):
	(assemble): Pass instructions thru asm-macroexpand before
	assembling.
	
	* lightning.c:  Use "~S" instead of "~A" in error messages.
	(scm_assemble): Allocate a JIT buffer based on the
	number of instructions to assemble.
	(imm2int): Do not prepend "scm_" for `subr' immediates.

	* disassemble.c (disassemble): Use AT&Ts syntax, not Intels.

2001-03-21  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* lightning.c (imm2int): Also accept immediates of the form
	`(label ...)', returning the address of the label, which must
	already be defined.  Take the label hash as a parameter for this.

2001-03-20  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* lightning.ops (jit_retval_i): Changed to "jit_retval".

	* rod.scm: Add "b" instruction as "jmpi" with a label target.
	(unconditional-branch): New instruction type.
	(1rop): Ignore type if it is `#f'.
	
	* lightning.c: Include <dlfcn.h>.
	(get_arg): Correctly pass arguments to error message as list.
	(sym_scm, sym_subr, imm2int): New, accept more types of immediates
	than old AS_INT.
	(AS_INT): Use imm2int.
	
	* configure.in: Generate "lightning/Makefile".
