This package really only contains one relevant file, ice-9/statprof
which defines the (ice-9 statprof) module.  In order to use the
statistical profiler, you need to first make sure you have a Guile
available that supports the itimer functions that statprof needs.
This means something greater than or equal to the Guile 1.5 unstable
CVS tree as of 2001-07-19.

You can check to make sure that everything is OK by running "make
check" from this directory.  If that succeeds, then you just need to
make sure that ./ice-9 is somewhere the Guile you're running can find
it.  You can do this by either:

  1) copying or symlinking it into a directory somewhere in your
     Guile's load path (type %load-path from any Guile prompt to see
     which directories your copy of Guile searches).

  2) adding this directory to your Guile's load path.  This can be
     done by either modifying %load-path like so:

       (set! %load-path (cons "this-source-dir" %load-path))

     or by setting the environment variable GUILE_LOAD_PATH
     appropriately.  i.e. in bash:

       export GUILE_LOAD_PATH=this-source-dir

See the README for brief documentation.
