	* Makefile.in (datadir, pkgdatadir, pkgverdatadir, subpkgdatadir,

Thu Aug  1 02:46:04 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Updated for new dist system.
	(dist-dir): New target.
	(manifest): Target deleted.
	* PLUGIN/this.configure (aux_files): Omit PLUGIN; it's a
	directory, and it needs special handling in the dist-dir target.
	Omit ../doc/ctax.texi; doc/Makefile.in takes care of that.
