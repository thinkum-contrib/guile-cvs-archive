This module contains scripts used by the maintainers of Guile to do
things like make nightly snapshots, copy the repository over to the
public CVS server, and so on.

Things which might be useful to Guile users should *not* go in this
module.  This should contain things which are only useful in carrying
out the maintainer's responsibilities.

The scripts generally expect a bunch of environment variables to be
set telling it where to find things (repositories, remote machines,
etc.).  These environment variables are documented in comments at the
top of each script.
